According to the 2018 FIC report, a colossal  figure of USD 417 million was the amount the nation lost to corruption. This was caused partly by inflated contract prices and wasteful procurement and has been referred to in some circles as a self inflicted wound. Going into 2020 as a wounded nation entails that we need to carry out some emergency measures and this includes coming up with practical solutions to recover that gigantic amount. People working in the farm have unfortunately  eaten even the seeds leaving our mother Zambia limping. We must stop corruption, wastefulness and theft of public resources if we have to recover as a nation. It is time that we conduct a life style audit to recover stolen money to boost government coffers. We can't be this broke as a nation endowed with resources such as minerals.  We have just abused and plundered our state resources. We must carry out a life style audit and arrest the criminals. This can cover for instance a period of three years back, that is from 2016 to 2019. The categories often mentioned and proposed to be targeted are the following: 1) Politicians in power abusing state resources by awarding their businesses with  government contracts at  inflated prices. Carry out life style audit 2) ZRA being key in revenue collection for the government is cardinal in this exercise. Top management, senior managers and lower ranking employees are suspects in plundering state resources as they allegedly diverge into their pockets what belongs to the state coffers. Carry out life style audit. 3) Zesco load shedding has come because of Zesco's poor financial standing due to amongst others alleged abuse of authority, corruption and illegal legal tendering with inflated contract prices. Who have been benefitting from such contracts? Target top management and senior managers. Carry out life style audit 4) Senior civil servants have been mentioned in plundering public resources. Carry out life style audit To arrest the ever increasing rampant looting and plundering of public resources which has left government coffers bleeding, carry out life style audit on all senior leaders in government including quasi government institutions. This will Instill sanity in the system. Government money has been illegally transferred into people's pockets. In South Africa they are following such individuals legally of course and not witch hunting. THE Industrial Development Corporation (IDC) has dissolved the board of directors at Times Printpak and removed some senior management staff in a restructuring plan to revive the financially challenged company. Government must ensure Times of Zambia assets are not plundered during the restructuring exercise. When is the long overdue announcement of Zesco restructuring because if anything Zesco is technically insolvent and in intensive care unit and very critical to the survival of the Zambian economy than Times of Zambia.  With the announced tariff increases effective 1st January 2020 the fear and concern is that as long as the existing leakages identified by the restructuring task force are not sealed, the exercise could be futile in achieving improved profitability for the utility and just a further drain on the already heavily taxed Zambians. You can not fix a problem while maintaining the same people and systems that created it. Carry out life style audit and set up the commission of inquiry to pursue the plunderers. The move will not only recover some funds but most importantly will deter the future would - be plunderers. By this we will have arrested the growing trend of looting of public resources.

They will  give HH all tags. Look here in 2015 ECL declared his wealth at K2.5 Million. His salary when elected was about K37,000 per month. By Dec 2017 (about 16months) ECL was worth K23million. How possible that through allowances, salary he managed to make K20million in 16months? Then many of us Zambians would have been fairly rich or doing fine in life. Let him then teach us we do the same. Go to state Lodge and look at the houses these PF guys have in built between 2016 elections and now. The national House for Kaunda look like a Servants quarter of a visitors house. Go to Chamba Valley see how many plots and houses alleged to be for a named law maker. We may have roads in Lusaka and some being constructed but think of the nation at large. Main roads like Great East, North, Copperbelt, Southern maybe done. Go in districts you will realise PF has done nothing much. I will site districts: Go to Eastern province Districts and constituencies.  Chasefu has no roads, Vibwi, Chadiza, Kasenengwa, Chipangali, Malambo, Msanzala, etc have no. Go to Muchinga. Go to Luapula. Only Mansa has a road and the main road.  Check Kaputa etc you will cry. Go to southern province. There is no road in dundumwezi, no road in mapatizya, Kalomo,  kazungula to sesheke, mulobezi no roads. Go to Mongu. The same is the case with health facilities and education. For one known reason Lusaka look like Dubai that's where their businesses are and that's where they stay. We can't go on blaming God for economical challenges that's why we have leaders and President to offer policies and strategies in such times. As at now, it is as good as not having leadership so that we look up to God for favour. The problem is that PF is myopic. They don't think ahead of current situation but they manage to think ahead of their wealth. The hunger we have now is Artificial. When we had a bumper harvest in 2017, we decided to sale our maize outside. Remember the illegal case of export to Malawi which led to the firing of Malawian Agriculture Minister and arrest of Saviour Chishimba. In 2018 the government instructed farmers both small and large scale to sale maize wherever they wanted as there was no money for the purchase through FRA. Government gave FRA K650 to buy maize. Famers sold where there was competitive prices. If we had kept our maize this hunger and mealie meal prices wouldn't have affected us. Legally we have transported over 500 Mukula Containers (I don't know how many illegal) but what can we point at that this is what we have gained? Just few months ago we were struggling to find $40m to pay ESKOM, we have a bill with Maamba power plant. So where is mukula  money. If we had objective and fair leaders, Mukula money would have helped us pay Euro bond and other loans we have. But our personal pockets are more important. PF actually is not corrupt but they are hardcore thieves. Maiko,102,88,7,5,,1,1,36,2919899724727425,/story.php?story_fbid=2919899724727425&id=129987587052000

This is the same ministry Malupenga looted millions of US Dollars but the crime has been swept under the carpet though police finalised investigations.

On 14 July 2014, then North-Western Permanent Secretary Amos Malupenga broke down and cried like a baby when he was warned and cautioned over corruption in the digital migration case he was involved in while he served as Permanent Secretary at the Ministry of Information. Investigative officers Ferguson Kombe and Diana Phiri both from Anti-Corruption Commission Headquarters in Lusaka recorded the warn and caution statement from Malupenga at the Anti-Corruption Offices in Solwezi. At this point, Malupenga burst into heavy crying and asked to be given 15 minutes to catch a breathe outside and collect himself and was heard mumbling that his enemies are the ones behind his being investigated for corruption. With a warm and caution statement recorded, Mr. Malupenga should soon face arrest for the heavy corruption and kickbacks he received during the digital migration project he presided over as PS at Ministry of Information. The digital migration tender was to provide the supply, delivery and commissioning of the country’s National Digital Terrestrial Television Broadcasting System. The ZPPA was concerned about the way in which Amos Malupenga, the now former permanent secretary of the Ministry, gave the tender. There were serious irregularities in the way Malupenga handled the Digital Migration tender some of which included purchasing of second hand equipment.

Reflecting on the year 2019, Phiri said there should be no retreating on the fight against corruption. He said President Edgar Lungu should be more focused in 2020. “Without malice whatsoever, the President (Lungu) needs to now show leadership. It should not be business as usual. President Lungu seem not to be serious or care about the welfare of the people. We are in an economic crisis created by the PF and Mr Lungu. Mr Lungu should be more serious as President in 2020,” Phiri said. “No retreat, no surrender on fighting corruption. He needs to be more serious and dedicated to work. Corruption in his government is what has made us to be where we are today.” He said the majority Zambians were suffering in silence. Phiri, a human rights activist, noted that the silent voice of the people would send President Lungu away from State House. “If there is something dangerous is a silent person. The silence of the Zambian people will speak so loud come 2021, that we have seen and it will happen,” he said. Phiri said the crisis the country was in today could only be resolved if the President shows serious leadership. And Phiri said 2019 had been a year of misery. “We have seen a lot of bad sides in 2019. The unprecedented hike in mealie meal, load-shedding… This is what 2019 has provided for us. But all this falls on the President who is Edgar Lungu. If the President is not showing well, nothing can change for the citizens,” Phiri said. “In 2019 we also observed a lot of arrogance from those in authority. The political space reduced also. The PF cadres’ high levels of violence without regard to the law. Unfair dismissals. This is what the PF presented to us in 2019. We hope things can slightly change going in 2020. It is those in authority to make this become a reality.” He said poverty has been the order of the day for the citizens. “We have been doing little or nothing to improve the lives of the people of Zambia. When we speak like this we don’t mean to make the party in government unpopular but we want them to change the lives of the people,” said Phiri.

And the top command seem not bothered with their inability to protect citizens. Just few weeks ago, an officer from the Sheriffs of Zambia office was badly attacked by suspected cadres when he tried to enforce a Court Order - the Inspector General of police is much aware of this incident. And he is quiet! You see, the Sheriffs of Zambia Office is part of the Judiciary and established under Chapter 37 of the Laws of Zambia to among other things “receive and execute” all Writs from our Courts. That is the enforcement arm of the judiciary, which works closely with Zambia Police. But now this important office is under systematic attack! And the police is not doing anything! Those who owe money or have invaded land hire gangs to chase the officers of the Sheriffs office when they go to enforce Court Orders. A very sad phenomenon! This may breed counter-gangs. People will opt to hire gangs to enforce Court Orders if the police continue to refuse to protect them. I have a case in which the Sheriffs of Zambia has informed me that they cannot enforce my Court Order without police - who are not willing to accompany them because of the suspected cadres involved. This is lawlessness which cannot be condoned! I know of a widow who just lost her 60 acres of land in Lusaka West because police refused to accompany the Under-Sheriffs to execute the Writ of Possession after suspected cadres invaded her farmland. Those with money are opting to use unorthodox means by hiring Zambia National Service (ZNS) on the pretext of going clear their farm but in fact use them to chase squatters! Why should ZNS be doing police work? Where is the Police? The IG Kanganja is a friend of mine. Very lovely gentleman and extremely accessible! But I think he is failing to show leadership! This is what I told him this morning in my note to him, which read but only in part as follows: “this is very dangerous path as our country can slide into lawlessness. Kindly be on top of this issue. I do not think H.E President Edgar Lungu can condone cadres threatening sheriffs of Zambia officers carrying out official duties...”. In short, I was saying my IG friend is failing the nation!,108,94,4,,2,6,2,35,2918121584905239,/story.php?story_fbid=2918121584905239&id=129987587052000

By the grace of God, we once again stand here to testify, the abundance of his mercies, - this far we have come, even as we look forward to the New Year 2020, we remain focused and desirous for gender equality to be attained in Zambia.   The end of year provides the opportunity for us as individuals, organizations and indeed as a nation, to introspect and reflect on the trajectory we are charting. It’s a time to take stock of the achievements, failures, challenges and indeed lessons we have picked during the year ending.  As aptly put by Aristotle, “Knowing yourself is the beginning of all wisdom.” Surely, we also agree with Bryant McGrill that “a people who have had little self-reflection live life in a huge reality blind-spot”.  In our reflection therefore, we first want to note that inequality levels in Zambia remained high in 2019 around 0.525, indicated by low numbers of women in leadership positions, challenges with access to health services especially maternal health facilities for women as well as low education progression rates to higher levels by female learners. Even though the country has made strides in infrastructure development such as roads, schools and health posts, we note from our monitoring visits that most projects are yet to be finalised.  Further, the newly launched 2019 Human Development Index (HDI) Report states that Zambia has made improvements between 1990 and 2018 with the HDI value increasing from 0.424 to 0.591, an increase of 39.7 percent thereby ranking the country at 143 out of 189 countries and territories which puts the country in the medium human development category. This improvement is based on the three indicators: Life Expectancy, Schooling Years and Expected Years of Schooling. Life expectancy at birth increased by 14.3 years from 49.2 years in 1990 to 63.5 years in 2018. On the other hand, schooling years increased by 2.4 years while the expected years of schooling increased by 4.5 years.  Despite all these positives, we are aware that the country is still faced with a number of challenges which continued to impact on the livelihoods of the majority citizens during 2019. For example, not too long ago, we witnessed yet again increases in electricity tariffs and fuel pump prices, further straining the already economically constrained majority citizens. Let us analyze some issues as follows: Zambia’s indebtedness  The women’s movement remains deeply concerned with the country’s indebtedness, with the latest official figures indicating a total of US$10.23 billion external debt as at end of June 2019. Domestic debt in terms of securities and bonds as at end June 2019 also rose to K60.3 billion. NGOCC is aware that debt repayments have had a toll on government’s expenditure on and provision of social services such as education, health and social protection. We have sadly witnessed reduced funding allocation for most institutional operations within government during the year which has negatively impacted on the most vulnerable in our society, the majority being the women and children. For example, we have noted the compromised quality of education due to absence of basic learning materials and equipment; health institutions have not been spared from the pressure of overstretched facilities and services including limited availability of essential drugs.  Constitution making through the National Dialogue In 2019, an attempt was made at having a National Dialogue to promote national reconciliation and unity of purpose by the Church Mother Bodies which subsequently failed to meet its intended outcome. Eventually we saw the Government proceed to enact the National Dialogue Forum Act which was to facilitate for the review of the Constitution Amendment Act of 2016, the Electoral Processes Act and the Political Parties Bill.   Out of that process was born the now famous Constitution Bill 10 which has been a subject of national discourse in the recent past.  Our view is that the nation missed an opportunity to have a truly nationally-driven dialogue that would have addressed some of the political discontent and high levels of intolerance that the country has been witnessing. It has always been NGOCC’s position that the Church Mother Bodies have the moral and biblical responsibility to provide counsel whenever there is some dispute or indications of disunity in the nation. The women and men of God have the authority bestowed upon them by nature of their anointing to prevail upon difficult situations. It is our hope that as we go into 2020, ahead of 2021 General Elections, a process of honest and open dialogue will be undertaken, especially between the ruling party and the main opposition United Party for National Development (UPND). It is still our considered view that there is need for an honest review of the law Electoral Processes and the Public Order Act before the 2021 elections.  With regards Constitution Bill 10, it was our submission to the Parliamentary committee that the Bill contains some progressive and a number of retrogressive provisions. We are, therefore, happy that the Parliamentary Committee agreed with our position on a number of clauses that we submitted which are articulated in the Committee’s Report. Going forward, we would like to appeal to the Government to consider adopting the report of the Parliamentary Committee especially on the aspect of subjecting this important Constitution reform process to more broad-based consultation. In this regard, NGOCC will in 2020, engage both the ruling party and opposition political parties to find resolve to the impasse on the Constitution making process.  For far too long, Zambians have yearned for a good Constitution built on consensus, complete with an expanded Bill of Rights adopted through a National Referendum. Additionally, the gender equity and equality agenda should be fully implemented by the constitution of the Gender Equity and Equality Commission. We are still hopeful that the policy statement by His Excellency Dr. Edgar Chagwa Lungu on operationalizing the Gender Commission, did not fall on ‘deaf ears’ but that commitment will be shown by those responsible to work towards the realization of the Gender Equity and Equality Commission in the shortest time possible.  The Rule of Law and Justice Dispensation Zambia’s Amended Constitution of 2016 guarantees equality of all citizens before the law and in line with the Constitution Values and Principles, the constitution seeks to uphold human dignity, equity, social justice, equality and non-discrimination for all citizens. In addition, the Preamble of the said Constitution upholds human rights and “confirms the equal worth of women and men and their right to freely participate in, determine and build a sustainable political, legal, economic and social order”. In this regard, NGOCC welcomed the court ruling that ordered all Cabinet Ministers, that had stayed in office beyond Parliament closure prior to the 2016 General Election, to pay back all their emoluments obtained during the said period. It is unfortunate that we come to the end of the year with no information to the public that this court ruling has been complied with.  In addition, we have not witnessed any public efforts by relevant investigative bodies to follow up, adequately investigate and recommend for prosecution those named as having been involved in questionable financial transactions and corruption as per the Financial Intelligence Report of 2019. This status quo has the tendency to render the country to be viewed negatively by the outside world and has the potential to jeopardize external development support. In this regard, we have in mind donor financing towards HIV and AIDS and other basic health programmes, Social Cash Transfer, community focused interventions on women’s empowerment and promotion of girls’ access to education, among many others. NGOCC wishes to contend that justice dispensation must be obeyed in all respects without any selectivity and without regard to the type of matter upon which the courts have adjudicated on or needs to preside over.   Gender Based Violence The increased cases of Gender Based Violence (GBV) every year, is of great concern to the women’s movement in Zambia. Going by the 2019 statistics, it is clear that this scourge is on the upswing and still carrying a female face due to the continued marginalization and vulnerability of many women and girls. This can be illustrated through statistics which indicate that from a total of 773 child defilement cases recorded in the third quarter of 2019, 770 cases or 99.6% were against girls while only 3 cases or 0.4% were against boys. In response to this challenge, NGOCC in September 2019, convened a multi-stakeholder National Indaba to find solutions to this crisis. The Indaba was unanimous in acknowledging that all citizens have a role to play in order to put a stop to this dehumanizing vice by ending the culture of silence around GBV and taking specific actions to bring all perpetrators to justice.  NGOCC was also actively engaged on matters of ending Child Marriage (mostly negatively impacting on girl children) which have remained high in the country at 31%. We note that mostly girls have been at the receiving end of this societal negative practice and hence driving the female faced poverty cycle. Child Marriage is a matter that has various dimensions including social exclusion of those impacted; health implications which many times may be fatal; economic vulnerability of those facing this predicament as well as emotional and psychological aspects which creep in overtime. This further excludes the affected young women and girls from actively engaging on issues that matter in society. The role that traditional leaders continue to play in ending this vice is commendable and it is our hope that many others will join this advocacy journey in 2020 and beyond. NGOCC will continue to invest its time and resources on matters focused on ending GBV and Child Marriage.   Climate Change and Load Shedding  The effects of Climate Change on the global world and Zambia’s development trajectory are real and calling for magnanimity of purpose in terms of mitigation and adaptability strategies. In 2019, we witnessed the deeply felt extent of this global effect on our environment in terms of the drought which hit (to a large extent) the southern and western parts of the country including the serious receding water levels in our rivers and major lake, Kariba. In addition, we noted that policy statements from our Executive were reassuring.  However, we await more practical and sustainable measures, including adequate resourcing of water harvesting innovations, climate smart agricultural interventions coupled with relevant research and development in order to address the effects of climate change on our people, especially as they affect the women and children. This also calls for conscious strategies in the manner in which our forest reserves are handled.  NGOCC also remains deeply concerned with the never ending operational and financial lapses with the Farmer Input Support Programme, Food Security Pack and other social protection mechanisms.   The load management by ZESCO has had adverse effects on businesses and indeed most low and middle income households. We have learnt that small businesses have literally been grounded to a halt in situations where alternative options have proved unaffordable by most small and medium enterprises. Sadly, among the worst hit are the fresh foods businesses which are owned mostly by women in the informal sector. It is NGOCC considered view that the nation needs to marshal the needed political will and accountability mechanisms on this critical development ingredient (energy). It is time that the nation directs more investment in alternative energy solutions for industry and household consumption in order to meaningfully address the situation.  Political Violence and Women’s Participation in Politics  In 2019, NGOCC remained deeply saddened at the high levels of political violence characterizing the conduct of major partisan political players. We are particularly concerned at the high levels of intolerance and seemingly absence of political ideological contestation between the two major political parties - the Patriotic Front (PF) and United Party for National Development (UPND) - which even led to needless loss of lives. Bye-Elections in 2019 were no longer an anticipated democratic space to spur electorates into exercising their right to vote given the violent nature of campaigns. The Sesheke, Kaoma and Roan Bye-Elections are examples of retrogressive campaigning that do not inspire confidence in our political party electioneering. In addition, we witnessed the sad violation and maiming of the president for Patriots for Economic Progress, Mr Sean Tembo, while exercising his rights on a publicly known accountability matter.  With all the above, it is NGOCC’s considered view that the Zambia Police did not adequately rise to the occasion in their role of maintaining law and order. Sadly, NGOCC is also aware that those officers who had exhibited professionalism while conducting their duties impartially were met with dismissals, much to the discontent of peace-loving citizens. We all know for a fact that political violence of any form does not encourage much of women’s participation both as candidates as well as voters. No wonder we saw participating political parties not prioritizing adoption of women even in constituencies which had been rendered vacant due to the demise of female Parliamentary holders.  May the souls of Honourable Patricia Mwachingwele and Honorable Rosaria Fundanga, who left us in 2019, rest in eternal peace. Political violence should therefore be an area of greater focus going forward especially given Zambia’s standing on the continent and beyond, as a beacon of peace in the handing over of government power from one regime to another. We also commend the Zambia Police for beginning the disarming process for all political cadres and implore them to be professional and conduct themselves in a fair and non-partisan manner.  CONCLUSION  In conclusion we would like to appeal to all Zambians to put the country first in everything that we do. Before anything else, we are all Zambians with a duty to advance our country’s development pathway. By virtue of our collective resolve to uphold the “One Zambia, One Nation Motto”, we are all one people, female and male, regardless of tribe, colour, creed or political affiliation. Therefore, let us not allow politics or anything else to divide our great country.  On behalf of the NGOCC entire membership of 97 organisations, Board, Management and Staff we wish every Zambian a Happy and Prosperous 2020!

Zambia Daily Mail has always been a poorer cousin to the Times of Zambia. Now the IDC has directed that the 'poor', who has never been profitable,  should 'take-over' and run the ToZ's  assets. What is going on here? Alert Zambians should ensure that ToZ's assets are not vandalised, or sold off to cartels for a song. Some such asserts include the one storey building in Ndola's Kabelenga Rd;  the Lusaka office in Freedom Way; townhouses in Ndola's Mitengo area, and; the $1.4 million worth second- hand (old but) refurbished printing machine bought from a fake Taiwanese company, on borrowed money from Finance Bank, a few years ago [but that is a story for another day]. For now, the important thing is to ensure that ToZ's assets, which belong to the Zambian people as a whole, are not stripped under the rubric of the intended merger between the ToZ and the ZDM. Let's learn from the mistakes of the Chiluba era. ZUJ, PAZA, MISA and Parliament should request for an independent audit of the ToZ asserts before the merger proceeds in earnest. What criteria did the IDC use in determining the necessity for the dismissal of the ToZ Board and ED and transferring their responsibilities to the poor cousin, the ZDM?

Chungu, infamously known as Jerry Fingers is now detained at Kamwala remand prison.  His lawyer Kelvin Bwalya Fube (KBF) Monday afternoon tried in vain to convince a high court judge to overrule the magistrate court.  In this matter, Lieutenant General Chimese is accused of abuse of authority and jointly charged with Chungu with money laundering. Last month, Deputy chief State advocate Gamaliel Zimba told magistrate Nsunge Chanda that following the testimony of Zimbabwean Tendai Joe, a builder, that Chungu sent him K700 in August this year through Airtel money asking him to leave the country on the pretext that the Drug Enforcement Commission wanted to arrest him because he had details of the houses he constructed in Ibex Hill. Zimba told court that the State was worried that Chungu was interfering with witnesses by asking Tendai to leave the country. He said if Chungu’s behaviour was not curtailed, there was a possibility of him further interfering with State witnesses. He asked the court to consider exercising its discretion and cancel Chungu’s police bond and remand him in custody. “We have a concern emanating from the testimony of PW7 (Tendai), to the effect that A2 (James Chungu) reached out to him, requesting that he leaves the country. The State finds that particularly worrisome and tantamount to interference. Our fear is that if that is not curtailed, there is a possibility of interference with State witnesses,” Zimba said. “We are faced with a situation where Mr James Chungu is on police bond which bond he has continued to enjoy up to now, but the testimony of Tendai is worrisome to say the least in so far as the State deems as an interference. We now beseech this honourable court to consider exercising its discretion by way of cancellation of the police bond,” said Zimba. But defence lawyer Kelvin Bwalya Fube said the defence was taken by surprise, and therefore needed fresh instructions from their client. He said the defence would respond at the next hearing to enable them look at the procedure that was being employed by the State. Masaka Joe Tendai in his testimony disclosed that Chungu sent him a text message notifying him that his friends had gone back to Zimbabwe and that he was going to send him a K700 so that he could also go back. Tendai said he told Chungu that he was merely working and there was no need for the DEC to arrest him but Chungu insisted that he leaves the country. He said that after Chungu gave him the K700, he stopped communicating with him and he used the money to pay for his rentals. The builder said Chungu thought he had travelled back to Zimbabwe but was surprised to see him in court the day he testified. Earlier, Saviour Chapepa, an electrician, testified that he wired Chimese’s alleged houses in Ibex Hill and in Baobab area but he stopped working for him after Dexter Maseka brought two electricians from ZAF. The 37-year-old testified that in 2012, Tendai called him to help install iron bars in a single storey house in Ibex Hill and he was given four general workers to help him. Chapepa said that when he finished installing the iron bars, he asked Zambia Air Force Squadron pilot Cephas Mudala to engage him in relation to electrifying the houses as he was a supervisor and project manager of the properties. “Captain Mudala was the one who was buying the materials and taking care of everything that was needed at the plot. I wrote down the requirements and he went and bought them,” Chapepa said. He told the court that he put pipes and did the wiring in the single storey house, a gym, a cottage and eight flats. He said when they finished building the (nine) flats, he installed pipes and wired the houses and it was at this point that Mudala left in 2014 and handed over the supervision of the construction works to ZAF Procurement officer Dexter Maseka. He said Maseka was the supervisor and he used to frequently visit the construction site. Chapepa said later Maseka took him to Baobab to do piping for a wall fence. He said Maseka brought two more electricians from ZAF to install electrical fittings. He said himself and Maseka continued differing and after a month he decided to quit his job in 2015. Chapepa told the court he was told that the properties belonged to Lt Gen Chimese. “The time I was picked by Tendai, he told me it was for the ZAF commander. Even him (Lt Gen Chimese) he used to come at the site. Everybody used to say that ‘this is the boss, the ZAF commander, when he comes to the site,” Chapepa said. He further claimed that he would give Maseka quotations and Lt Gen Chimese would sometimes pay him physically. The matter comes today November 20 for a response from the defence.,179,161,6,1,5,6,,86,2916159968434734,/story.php?story_fbid=2916159968434734&id=129987587052000

Some where in June this year some fisher men discovered some gold deposits along Chongwe river around Namanongo area. This triggered some illegal mining activities which has been going on since then! Due to some economic hardships and poverty levels in some parts of the country, people have been flocking to the area as far as Northen, East and Western parts to the area. But when ZAWA heard of the development they began to send their game rangers to disrupt the illegal miners! But what is shocking is whether the game Rangers where instructed to beat and confiscate things from the illegal miners by their bosses or not. There was an operation yesterday on Sunday which started at four roads area where people were being harassed as though they were criminals.  No one was spared, the old or young either women or men, people were hurt by about 8 game Rangers some who were armed. The illegal miners were being forced to be searched and robbed of their income. A buyer was robbed of up to K30,000.  My brother was robbed off about K5000 and the people were more than 300 all of whom had their goods destroyed or taken by the same game Rangers. As I write there are reports of some people who sustained fractures in the process of being kicked with heavy boots and back of rifleguns. Our worry is the torturing of the people like slaves and having their money and goods taken off some being left stranded without transport back to their places.  Please if ZAWA did not instruct to beat and confiscate money and goods from the illegal miners who were just trying to find a living by the those game Rangers, then something must be done to help recover the stollen goods. The ZAWA guys could have just come and displace the people peacefully than torturing them like slaves in their own village or nation plus confiscating their money! Questions we ask: will those 8 game Rangers remit the money to the government they got or what? In reality those guys walked away with something above K500000! Awe mwandi it's tough. My brother is complaining of his backbone. Why can't the government come in to give the people a period of time to mine so as to cushion hunger in the area which have been affected by climate change? As we speak people in the area so far has received poor rainfall and there is no future in farming! Many people had been helped by mining and resort to buy mealie meal costing about K180 in the area!

President Edgar Lungu has shown a strange way of enforcing discipline in his government. He refused to fire his Minister Ronald Chitotela despite being charged and arrested for gross acts of corruption by the Anti Corruption Commission(ACC). Even after the Director of Public Prosecution (DPP) approved the prosecution of Chitotela, and he spent many months appearing in a criminal court on corruption allegations, President Lungu refused to fire Chitotela. But he fired Chishimba Kambwili on mere allegations that the ACC were investigating him. Another case is that of his advisor for political affairs, Kaizer Zulu. Despite being arrested, and appearing in the Lusaka Magistrate Court, despite beating and brutalizing numerous innocent people, and despite his weekly scandals, Zulu was never fired. To date, although Kaizer Zulu was replaced by another person, his dismissal has not been announced or confirmed by State House. Then there is a fresh case of the Local Government Permanent Secretary, Edward Chomba who pronounced the Alick Nkhata Fly-Over Bridge as a death trap but was sharply contradicted by his Minister, Charles Banda and Chomba's statement disowned. Chomba has not been fired. President Lungu has not punished anyone for the theft and loss of public funds as cited in the Auditor General's Report, and the Financial Intelligence Centre Report exposing the Loss of K6.1billion. And you have Foreign Affairs Permanent Secretary, Ronald Simwiinga, who has been named in a divorce scandal and wrecking a marriage of Musamba and Lombe Okpara. According to the petition filed in the Lusaka High Court for the dissolution of their marriage, Lombe Okpara said his marriage to Musamba Mulenga Okpara was wrecked by the adulterous Affairs his wife had with PS Simwiinga and Patrick Mwanawasa. And if Kasolo contradicted State House in the salary reduction, President Lungu has proceeded to appoint Chris Zumani Zimba as his advisor, who labeled him as Zambia's worst and most corrupt leader.

The Association's National Secretary Sydney Chewe says for long distance routes, the association has proposed an increase of K 20 to K 65. And Mr. Chewe says the decision by the Energy regulation Board to increase fuel prices has left the association with no option but to increase the fairs in order to sustain their businesses.

The reason is rather simple. According to the FIC report we lost US$417 million to corruption in 2018 alone! The compound value of this money is colossal and shocking. Millions of dollars have been lost in inflated and wasteful procurements. We clearly did not need a state of the art presidential jet at this moment in our economic journey. Further, spending US$ 42 million on fire tenders which could have been bought for much much less is not wise when other African countries are using similar amounts on building solar electricity plants. We have bought ambulances from middle men at colossal sums only to be embarrassed by an announcement by a donor country that they had purchased and donated similar ambulances to us at less than 25% of the price. The list goes on and on and on. Our wounds are self inflicted - caused from within our own house. Corruption and wastefulness got us where we are! No economic strategy will work without first stopping the leakages caused by corruption, wastefulness and theft.

Does this sound familiar with what we are witnessing and being subjected to nowadays in the PF Administration? Yes, but the only difference is that the comedy of errors we are witnessing in the PF GOVT is not something close to being FUNNY to make you and me to clap or laugh but one situation that is more often making us weep and cry as if we are watching a horror movie called This is your Zambia today. But how have these guys - the PF general membership and the PF Government and higher hierarchy, in particular found themselves in this circus and comedy of errors? The simple answer is through the recruitment, appointments and hiring of total strangers to the party, the so called New Comers being infused into the party's higher hierarchy.  It's these same new comers who are now  being allowed and being given control of some of the most important and strategic responsibilities in the party and Govt such as the Media functionalities. The same new comers, perhaps with little or completely with no understanding of the values, ideals and ideologies on which PF was founded by the founding fathers.  The same new comers with perhaps little or no understanding and appreciation of the PF policies.  The same new comers with perhaps little or no understanding and appreciation of the PF party manifesto and its embedded messages of pro poor government and lower taxes. Fellow Zambians, let me attempt to share some of the already well known background checks on some of the prominent new comers into the PF; Dora Siliya, Sunday Chanda and Antonio Mwanza, the three chosen ones who have now assumed and have been given the responsibilities of running and managing the directorates of  Govt as well as the PF Party propaganda machinery, the Media. How much and how well these people understand the PF manifesto is topic for another day.  But suffice to say that as Zambians as well as all the genuine PF general membership, we are yet to see and hear Dora, Sunday and Antonio articulate PF policies and programs.  So far what we hear from them is all about HH and the UPND. The PF media Hot-air Hallucination (HH) syndrome, it seems, is just one typical example of their failure to articulate and sell and market the party's policies and programs to the Zambians. It's one typical example of thier total denial and failure to comprehend the realization that as media team, their job description is to sell and market the PF party policies and not to tell us zambians about who eats with HH and many other baseless and off tune accusations. A political party manifesto is not just an ordinary document that any new comer of any political party can just pick from the shelves and start reading in order to win some job appointment, a manifesto is not some literature one can just pick from the shelves and start reading like someone studying for the ZIALE exams.  Manifestos need to be owned, be part and parcel of someone's purpose of joining and belonging to any party and to be passionately understood for ease of information dissemination to the voting masses. A manifesto is any party's selIing and marketing tool, it's not for new comers, It's not for pretenders. Some may argue that there's nothing wrong with PF welcoming newcomers. Of course there is nothing wrong, as long as those new comers background checks confirm that their intentions for joining the party or accepting any available positions are genuine and are motivated by the love of the policies and programs . Not just opportunism.. Not with hidden skeletons that will end up embarrassing them when the members of the public start retrieving their old offending posts from Facebook archives. BRIEF BACKGROUND CHECKS: - Dora Siliya, when she was still in the MMD opposition, continued her ruthless and relentless attacks on PF and the founding President Sata. In March 2013, Dora Siliya as MMD MP was captured by camera in parliament raising her middle finger towards the PF Ministers and MPs, an insulting gesture. This act was widely condemned inside and outside parliament. But Dora Siliya received maximum support from the opposition MMD Youths, led by then MMD Die Hard National Coordinator Bowman Lusambo, who instead launched his own attacks on the Speaker of the National Assembly Patrick Matibini. Lusambo said instead of attacking Dora Siliya, the nation should be focusing on forcing Speaker Matibini to resign for allegedly failing to uphold integrity in the conduct of his duties. Lusambo '' We should be more concerned about removing the Speaker because WE HAVE A PF CADRE FOR A SPEAKER. '' Bowman Lusambo is now not only eating cheese but also PF Minister for Lusaka Province, a member of the front bench in Patrick Matibini led parliament. Dora Siliya later on joined PF from MMD in May 2015, seven (7) months after the death of the PF founding father Michael Chilufya SATA. Sunday Chanda, prior to the 2011 General elections with intent to injure the reputation of opposition PF President Sata, made some overtures, through pictures and imitation voice notes. This recordings and pictures of two girls kissing were meant to show that SATA was promoting, supporting and receiving external funding for Homosexual campaigns.  This is according to one James Lukuku who is said to have been approached by Sunday Chanda  for financial support to enable him, Sunday Chanda to carry out some dirty media campaign project of exposing SATA as an Homosexual campaigner.  James Lukuku was then ruling party MMD Lusaka Province Youth Secretary. Sunday Chanda later on joined PF in September 2014, three years after PF won the elections and one month before the death of President SATA. Antonio Mwanza, in February 2014, then FDD spokesperson unleashed a scathing media statement attack on PF President, regarding the Constitution amendment process the PF administration had embarked on. Antonio said: '' SATA should not forget that no matter what happens in 2016 or beyond, he will be made to account for his stay in State House when he leaves that office." Antonio concluded his scathing attack. SATA never had the chance to reach 2016, he died nine months later in King Edward Hospital, UK. Antonio Mwanza later on joined SATA's PF party in January 2018. Before am called bitter and all other insulting narratives, please let it be known that am not a member, have never been a member and will never be a member of PF party.  My motivation to write this article is simply to show sympathy to those genuine old founding members of PF who have been sidelined all this long, in preference to the imported members into the PF party;  The new comers, The strangers.  Those who are now eating cheese.  If you so wish, you can go ahead and insult me today, but you will remember and thank me later, in due course. Friday Kashiwa.

Papa, please give us a signal of where to go, we want to stay in PF the party you left us with but we seem not to be wanted  here because the MMD have invaded PF and they mock us calling  themselves being more PF than some of us sidelined.  Please Papa give us a signal of what we should do with them.

Papa why did you go so quickly to be with the lord we are in trouble here and we are suffering, as I am writing this message to you here tears are rolling down my chicks  - Papa why us? please, please give us a signal.  Papa the government you left 50% of it, is controlled by those that beat and persecuted some of  us PF  cadres in different forms. Because of that , our cadres who sacrificed with you in the tunnels and trenches are not able to visit those offices for help because those in those offices now , are looking after the welfare of their own people from MMD at the expense of our cadres.   Papa why don't you come for 1 week  and correct this trend after which you back to where you are resting, because the leader you left me with and instructed me to help become your successor has a very good heart and he means well for Zambians as a person but I don't know why, he listens to lies from those that have self interests by telling lies about some of us who have fallen victims without calling us so that he hears our side of the reported stories to deffend ourselves but chooses to believe them and  sideline us, why, why.

I have nothing to tell them because our president doesn't want me to see him so that I explain to him what the funders of the sugar project want to hear from the president in order to have political protection of their investment because the amounts involved  is huge, tens of billions of dollars. The vendors still ask but why Angoni our government which you and us suffered for so much to put in office has not given you an office so that you protect us from this council harassment?

ObjectId("5e0ca44f4c36d57ff9611bdf"),Zambian Watchdog,,2019-12-28 18:24:29,Dear Editor,  Allow me to express my displeasure at the happenings at Topstar. There are Chinese and Zambian staff that are collectively frustrating the efforts of many employees of the company. In particular, one Zambian employee by the name of Anthony Njobvu has been working with Chinese within the company to frustrate his colleagues. He has been receiving undue favours from top Chinese staff in exchange for him giving them negative information about Zambian staff, a situation that has resulted into a lot of distrust and loss of morale. Furthermore, there is a Chinese employee by the name of Grady who is at the moment the defacto sales director yet he was introduced at the time of his arrival as an intern in the sales department. This situation leaves us to wonder whether the immigration and labor laws now allow foreign nationals to work in such capacities. In addition to this, all sales employees have been forced to install WeChat, which is a Chinese chatting app in which group they have added the Chinese staff who were removed from the country. In other words, the Chinese staff who were deported continue to issue instructions to staff here in Zambian even after being removed from this country. Without malice or prejudice, we urge the department of immigration and the labor ministry to come and check the happenings at the company for themselves.

By Rueben Lupupa Lifuka The proposed slashing of salaries of the President, Cabinet Ministers and some senior government officials, is a mockery of the suffering masses. Firstly, the slashing of salaries should be mutual and some government officials who will be “conscripted” into this scheme, may have their own challenges and need their full salaries.  Secondly, if indeed the desire Is to channel funds to be saved from this salary reduction to mitigate the impacts of the ZESCO tariff hike and fuel increase, then I could suggest a number of areas where government could make massive savings.  Government should consider selling the Presidential jets as well as some of the ministerial vehicles which are huge fuel guzzlers. Freeze all purchases of new vehicles and furniture- unless this is absolutely necessary.  Further, PreIdent Lungu should in 2020 cut down on foreign travel by 50 percent and also reduce to the barest minimum the presidential delegations. Government should also fully enforce the austerity measure of non business travel for all Government officials including Ministers. I have on many occasions seen Ministers traveling business class.  We should use  our embassies and high commissions - Ministers should only travel where it is absolutely necessary.  All by elections especially those that are politically engineered in 2020, through resignations should not be conducted until 2021.  This will definitely save the government huge amounts of money. Most of the government functions like May Day, African Freedom etc should be celebrated without the usual fanfare and parties. Cut back on the numerous workshops held by different government departments and ministries. Address the huge national wastage of resources in the public service. STOP the setting up of the national airline - it is not a priority. Sell off all loss making State Owned Enterprises - government should stop pumping money into such entities. Let us be serious and quit taking talking as an industry in this country. Slashing salaries alone will not mitigate the suffering of the people.,620,559,15,40,4,2,,159,2911417858908945,/story.php?story_fbid=2911417858908945&id=129987587052000

He is entitled to 15 percent salary increment each year depending on his performance appraisals by the Board of Directors. In second year running, the Board of Directors approved his salary increment based on his satisfactory performance as outlined in the score sheet of his performance appraisal for 2019.  Meanwhile, Sangwapo, based on his 15 percent salary increment, obtained a mortgage from a local bank, which he envisaged to pay back on monthly basis based on the 15 percent salary increment. The bank approved his mortgage based on his salary after he presented his pay-slip as proof of his income. During this same period, the country faced a number of economic challenges which led to the President to cut salaries of senior government officials including parastatal chiefs like Sangwapo to between 20 to 10 percent. This decision was made unilaterally without consulting the affected workers. With the aid of case law and statutes, identify the legal issues in this scenario. Further, advice Sangwapo of his legal rights and whether the reduction of his salary is legal. What are the remedies available for the bank should Sangwapo default on his mortgage due to the salary cut. (20 marks). This is the question likely to be posed to law students studying Labour and Employment Law. The question has also some constitutional law involved.

In his view he will cut top officials salaries by 20% and that includes him, the medium ones by 15% and the lower ones by 10% and the money raised from this will be channeled to offset the impact on the hikes, sadly for Zambians how this will be done hasn't been explained. Firstly, suppose this is done, how will citizens know for a fact that the cuts have been effected when they are not even privy to the actual salaries of these top officials? Secondly, let's put the average number top government officials that will be affected by the cut to one thousand, and each earning around an average K40, 000, 15% being the mean percentage. 15% of K40,000 is K6000 multiply that by 1000 officials and you raise K6,000,000 monthly. How will this K6,000 000 cushion the hike in fuel prices and the soon to be effected hike on electricity taking into consideration that its individual households that are affected by all these hikes? Thirdly, how certain are we that the amount raised will surely be allocated for mitigatory measures with the rampant corruption within the Patriotic Front government that has constantly been embroiled in so many allegations starting with inflation of prices on Fire Trucks, Ambulances, Road construction costs, self allocation of state land and the illegal sale of Mukula trees to the Chinese? Fourthly, the top, medium and lower high government officials to whom cuts are to be made will not be affected by them coz their salaries are already high and many have government contracts and kickbacks from Chinese contractors aside of their salaries. Lastly, if the president is sure this amount raised from the salary cuts will cushion the effect of these two hikes; fuel and electricity, why not halt the hikes and channel the money directly to Zesco and ERB to offset their losses by the none hike? It is clear from the rationale the president has used to come up with such a solution that he is out of touch with reality and has unpragmatic methods of solving economic and financial problems the country is facing right now. And aside of the many comical things he has done this year (2019), I.e asking the people of Bauleni to vote for PF because he is the one who releases money for development or even jumping up and down in jubilation for being called "bamene bali nakasa ka ndalama" translated "the one with the keys to state financial resources," his reasoning and act to come up with this nonsensical mitigatory solution wins him the "Comedian Of The Year" Award.

By: Anthony Bwalya - UPND Member It is important for us to mention, that in respect of both fuel and electricity pricing, the United Party for National Development (UPND) has consistently provided sound alternatives aimed at giving consumers extended relief through the recall or suspension of controllable cost components in respect of the pump price of fuel, and a complete reform of the fuel supply chain to eliminate unnecessary costs. The UPND has also provided insights directed at improving functional and management efficiencies at ZESCO to remove pricing inefficiencies which cost both ZESCO and consumers money. Under proposals by the UPND, the pump price of fuel should and can cost at least 25%  or K4 LESS than under the current PF regime, and we have demonstrated which cost components can be recalled or adjusted downwards:  1.Suspending excise duty 2.Suspending strategic reserve fund fee 3. Halving Value Added Tax (VAT) 4. Cancel dealer margin The aforementioned fuel pump price components are firmly under the control of government, but instead of the PF leveraging this position to stabilize the pump price, they are exploiting these controllable margins to benefit government officials, party officials, the party and their business associates. But the Patriotic Front regime has continued their reckless attack on the poor majority Zambians by pursuing destructive public policies which impoverish the most poor while increasing the advantage of the wealthy minority, particularly the political ruling elites. With the current loadshedding estimated to cost a minimum $7bn, it is poor households who are poised to be sacrificed at the altar of satanic political practices of the PF, through loss of incomes, jobs and with 1 in every 3 small businesses set to buckled down as the pressure of loadshedding mounts - with energy related business costs up by at least 35% per month. Thus, for the PF to sabotage what is left of already thinned out household incomes, jobs and small businesses by sanctioning a 10% and 200% hike in the price of fuel and electricity respectively, they have just magically condemned an estimated 1.5 million more Zambians from poorer households into abject poverty. In a few months, once the real effects of PF's failed economics kick in, we shall have at least 12.1 million Zambians living on less than $1.25 ( around K17.47) per day.  And these will be the lucky ones because close to 800,000 will not be guaranteed not even a single meal in a free and independent Zambia as food inflation is expected to rise to above 12% while incomes shrink and disappear. And in the midst of all this misery, President Edgar Lungu proceeded to insulting the collective conscience of Zambians by offering Zambians a paltry K4,471.86 per month from his TAX FREE salary, while he and his friends maintain all their other TAX FREE allowances as granted themselves under an inequitable Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices (Emoluments) Act, Cap 262. These ludicrous tax exemptions on allowances are given unto themselves under Section 3(1) and (2).  The reason the President's offer of a "paycut" makes a mockery of all of us is because those other lower ranking civil servants the President wants to withdraw 10% - 15% of their salaries actually have to pay tax on all their emoluments, including allowances.   This is what leadership incompetence looks like and this is what a regime increasingly out of touch with reality looks like, and this is certainly what a regime that has run out of progressive development ideas looks like. It is time for citizens to deliver the change they deserve.,136,120,3,5,,8,,17,2910543685663029,/story.php?story_fbid=2910543685663029&id=129987587052000

And Mpankata, the first ever member of parliament elected under the PF in the same Lupososhi in 2001, said the party risked creating a monster against itself by appointing mobilisation committees without the terms of reference. But PF secretary general Davies Mwila said he did not appoint Geoffrey Bwalya Mwamba (GBM) as vice-chairperson for mobilisation, saying the central committee ultimately decided on the matter. Speaking with Daily Revelation, Mpankata said he was in Lupososhi recently, where he saw first hand how the opposition UPND were destroying the PF’s structures. He said the leadership in the area, from the area member of parliament Lazarous Chungu, the district and constituency were all not committed towards the party’s cause. “I was just around Lupososhi to see how UPND is destroying our structures, and people are willingly going to UPND. If we don’t do anything we may find ourselves in mwamoneni,” Mpankata said. And Mpankata warned that the party would be creating a monster for itself by appointing mobilisation committees without the terms of reference. “Did you see what this guy Elvis Chanda said on Facebook? He was saying that they (mobilsation committees) don’t have boundaries and can go into any Ministry and in 90 days load shedding will end. This is creating confusion,” Mpankata said. “I am not against mobilisation committees, (but) the SG should bring the terms of reference to the central committee for ratification so that wherever they are going they will be guided. If we have not coached them properly we may end up creating a monster for ourselves.” Mpankata recently said the party had welcomed GBM with his profanity and given him huge responsibilities of mobilisation when everybody knew he had presidential ambitions. But Mwila said the recommendation for GBM’s appointment came through the party chairperson for mobilisation Richard Musukwa – who is also mines minister – the decision which the central committee ratified. “I have no power to go against the central committee, so he (Mpankata) cannot criticise the decision which he was party to,” said Mwila. On Mpankata’s statement that since the party had embraced GBM despite his insults against PF, the party should likewise seek out National Democratic Congress (NDC) leader Chishimba Kambwili as he had the potential to damage the ruling party’s electoral prospects by eating into their strongholds, Mwila said that was Mpankata’s personal opinion, but he respected it.,388,353,30,3,2,,,117,2910313672352697,/story.php?story_fbid=2910313672352697&id=129987587052000

If it is significant then let's reverse the hike in fuel prices and electricity tariffs so that the money raised through salary cuts goes to paying for fuel and electricity, otherwise it is a cosmetic move. I would propose the following: 1. Ensure there is no corruption because we lose a lot of resources through corruption as documented in auditor general's reports compared to the 15% salary reduction. We need improved management of natural resources.  2. Cut down on local and foreign trips for the President, his cabinet and all civil servants. The amount spent on one trip could actually be way move than what is saved from 15% salary cuts for 30 people. My President you have been mentioning cuts in trips but we see you travel with ministers and senior government officials almost every week visiting provinces. So most of the pronouncements remain on paper. 3. Let's cut the actual size of cabinet, 40 ministers is too much. Bring it down to 20 and  reduce the number of permanent secretaries and their deputies. We created these problems.  4. Merge and close some embassies. Retire some people and reallocate members of staff where necessary. We have been sending so many people into foreign service at a time the economy has been struggling. There is clear lack of coordination between the Ministries of Finance and Foreign Affairs. 5. After cutting down the size of cabinet and number of permanent secretaries, reduce their salaries by 50% and do away with most of the benefits.  6. Let's invest in expanding exports. ZNS, ZCS, NCZ, IDC.....have too much potential. If we do things the right way and put competent people to manage serious projects under these institutions, we shall soon be fine. Let's set priorities  right and take serious steps to implement them. We need policy consistency and improved overall economic management.  In conclusion, our challenge is poor economic management. The first step is to accept we have not done well and then move in with solutions. The longer we take to implement the much needed solutions the worse things get. The excuses and propaganda are not working. All indicators are showing that 2020 will be as bad as 2019 if not worse. There are no convincing measures put in place.

Seventy five percent of the workers at the council have running loans from various banks and they have had a rude shock of their lives to find that they have nothing to take back home. They have labelled their Town Clerk as a tyrant who has come to decampaign Patriotic Front - PF at the Council. The Council employees i met at the bank were visibly furious and insulted whoever brought Him (Seke) to the Council as he has scraped off all the little incentives that they used to have. Workers have argued that every institution has got some form of incentives but wonders why Mr. Seke should subject them to further suffering when the economy is very harsh and biting. They have further demanded an explanation as to how he is going to recover the money from Councilors who are not on Council payroll but had also paid on rebate. ''From the time Mr. Seke came to Kitwe, workers have been complaining that the man has no interest of the employees at heart and no one has spoken good of him, he is just busy decampaigning the President himself.This man doesn't consult, he just does things as he dreamed them, tukafilila munsenga mu 2021''. End of quote. ''Look our salary is K3,500 and we got a loan at K10,000, the bank deducts K1,200 loan recovery and Mr. Seke has deducted K1,750 so i have gone back with K550'' end of quote. From the time Mr. Mbulo Seke reported at Kitwe City Council, management has complained that the man lacks credible leadership and always works in isolation. Unionized workers have equally complained and they are looking up to the provincial as well as local Union leadership to take action against the person they call a dictator with tyranny leadership.

According to Hit In Juba, the Tanzanian govt had signed a deal with China Merchants Holdings International, China’s which meant the Chinese would build a port in Bagamoyo and a special economic zone to transform the country into a regional trade and transport hub. Tanzanian Parliament in May 2019 was now questioning Magufuli’s stance as the groundbreaking that was supposed to happen 4 years ago but is yet to take place. Magufuli explained his decision to halt the project temporarily by saying: Those investors are coming with tough conditions that can only be accepted by mad people. The investor told us once they build the port, there should be no any other port to be constructed all the way from Tanga to Mtwara south.

Recently, Zambia expelled American Ambassador Daniel Foote on unfounded allegations that he was promoting homosexuality in a Christian country, the move which didn't go well with many Zambians who agreed with the ambassador's assertion that leaders in the Zambian government in grand corruption practices and the corrupt were being handled with kids groves! Otherwise there is predicted worsening of economic situation in Zambia as America was among the major donors to Zambia and had immense economic global economic influence. In less than a week of chasing Ambassador Foote, AFDB cut support to Zambia. Some good economic governance commenters "prophesy" that more sanctions are coming on the way. This is sad especially that it comes at a time when citizens have been badly bruised economically. They are hungry, businesses are frustrated, eish!!! To all these misfits, the political debate is whether it's nature or its poor economic management. I am settled in understanding that the reversal movement of Zambian economy is largely hinged on poor economic management, theft by leaders, corruption, deficiency of economic foresight on the part of the current state economy drivers. In the end, this suffering carelessly bellowed on Zambians will spare no one regardless of political affiliation. Evil people multiply when good people remain silent on evils happening around.

Even the song that was used to officially open the Ngoma was carefully selected to praise the so called 'imfumu' who apparently was guest of honour (or dishonour) at the event. It was clear that artistes are literally beggars who cant survive without the mighty hand of the politicians. Gone are the days when artistes were the mirrors of society and voices for the voiceless like Rikki Illilonga, PK Chishala, Impi, Twice and many others who used their art to express and highlight  people's conditions of living and were able to provide checks and balances to the ruling elites.  Today, making it in an artistes career is all about singing at State House and at political rallies and being praise singers for the owners of 'kasaka kandalama' (the money bag). Already since last year, some musicians have been preoccupied with producing praise and campaign songs for politicians for the 2021 elections and creating artworks that give a good picture to leaders who have literally looted the country's treasury and sent the country into an economic graveyard. Of course every artiste is at liberty to lick whichever boot or booty they feel like. After all, It's called democracy. Sadly, artistes have now become PR managers for the people responsible for those figures we see in the Attorney General's Report, the EIA report and the FIC report and they are doing it better than qualified PR managers. Today, if an artistes spoke about the $42m for 42 fire trucks, the $288 ambulances, the cheap fuel from Saudi Arabia, the Mukula and wildlife theft, the lack of medicine in hospitals, the inflated cost of construction of roads, the huge external and domestic debt, the cost of doing business, youth unemployment, the tax burden or the general conditions of living of honest and non thieving citizens, they risk everything from police brutality to loss of jobs because they will be labelled as carriers of 'fake news' and opponents of the government. Not only that, they will be accused of being sponsored by HH or countries that want to promote homosexuality and regime change. To my fellow artists my message is simple: you have the POWER and you can decide what to do with it. In the end, posterity will judge all of us according to our contribution to society. As for me, I will not use my art to elevate anyone who is part of the reason why our country is economically crippled. After all, it's my democratic and moral right not to do so. Eat what you can today because tomorrow may never be yours. The crumbs you are picking at the foot of the golden table today might not be there tomorrow because even the table itself may be a pillar of salt.,1K,934,10,91,9,30,1,185,2908228745894523,/story.php?story_fbid=2908228745894523&id=129987587052000

Johann Jordan, chairperson of the Zambian Crocodile Farmers’ Association (ZCFA), said in a statement that if the export tax was not repealed soon, commercial crocodile farming in Zambia faced imminent collapse. “Since the export duty was introduced, crocodile farmers have paid US$350 000 [about R5,05 million] on skins exported, and this has sucked all the liquidity from the industry. Zambian crocodile skins are prized the world over for [use in] high-end footwear, handbags and garments, but now some US$1,3 million [R18,8 million] worth of crocodile skins are sitting in cold storage because farmers cannot raise the money upfront to pay the tax.” Jordan explained that Zambia’s commercial crocodile farming sector had already been struggling financially before the 10% export tax was implemented, and said production was on a downward trend. Information provided by the association said that while Zambia had exported just over 60 400 crocodile skins in 2015, this had dropped to almost 31 700 in 2018. The number of crocodile skins exported in 2019 was expected to be around 22 000. “There are more than 600 jobs at risk, mainly in rural areas. Bearing in mind that it takes about four years to establish a crocodile farm, the chance of any resurrection of the industry once [it has] collapsed is unlikely. Engagements between [the association] and [Zambia’s] Ministry of Finance since January 2019 have not resulted in the tax being reviewed.” According to Jordan, Zambia’s crocodile farming sector was an important foreign exchange earner. “It is an industry that should be attractive for long-term growth and not [for] short-term fiscal gain,” he said.,84,75,,,,5,4,9,2908174152566649,/story.php?story_fbid=2908174152566649&id=129987587052000

When Kariba Dam was built in 1959, they came with the British made Turbines, but these PF thieves with their Chinese friends namely Syno Hydro removed all the British madeones and replaced them with the Chinese Turbines. Those Chinese turbines uses a lot of water to generate electricity because they are of poor quality. As long as that is not replaced with the original American and British ones, then forget about having enough water and enough electricity. In fact, the British projections about that dam were designed to withstand 3 to 4 years of complete draught but can still run the British made turbines without losing too much water.

The vendors are intoragating me like a criminal by saying ,you and Mr. Sata looked after us well and allowed us to sell on the streets, because you said you were going to take us all to the new sugar plantations you are creating across the country, there after there will be no need for us to remain on the street but before you give us the jobs our own council are grabbing our goods, Why Angoni , they are asking me.  I have nothing to tell them because our president doesn't want me to see him so that I explain to him what the funders of the sugar project want to hear from the president in order to have political protection of their investment because the amounts involved  is huge, tens of billions of dollars. The vendors still ask but why Angoni our government which you and us suffered for so much to put in office has not given you an office so that you protect us from this council harassment? I have told them that let them wait because on Christmas today, I would be contacting you to get instructions on what to do next , this is the reason why I want you without delay to give us a signal before we enter 2020. Papa, the asignment you gave me 21days before you went to where you are with the Lord, should look after Lungu because Lungu is my brother, in that meeting on ground floor of your  statehouse office. Present in that meeting were you, me and brother Lungu.  I want to report to you today that according to your own words that with you beside Lungu you were sure Lungu would become what he is today.  Today on this Xmas of 2019, I am happy to report that I was with Lungu 24/7 before you answered the call of the Lord while awaiting your departure in that hospital bed in London at King George hospital, I squarely executed my asignment and my brother till today is President of Zambia , but I don't know why I am suffering today without any job to earn an income like he has done with some of my colleagues. Papa,my brother Lungu in state house has forgiven all the worst traitors you know and 50% of them occupy government offices today  except me  and some of your poor loyal cadres who strongly believed in you mentioned above, I don't know why life has been like this to us .  Please, please Papa  give us a signal so that you instruct us what to do next as we enter 2020.  Papa, that case of Angoni clearing vs Attorney General on non payment of our fees by MMD government on clearance of presidential motorcade which as you came to learn later was a trap to close my company Angoni because I was supporting you.  Remember, the same MMD government courts granted us relief after my lawyer Likando Kalaluka while working with Ellis&Co. successfully  worn that case against the MMD government to pay us what was due to us.   Papa even after you instructed in my presence  your predecessor President Lungu where we were flying to Solwezi for that parliamentary bye election caused by Lucky Mulusa, to pay me when he was Minister of justice.  Till today from 2006 I am not paid my money surely the  company that helped you form this same  government has not paid my dues.  When I ask the same lawyer  who won the case for me who is now Attorney General, he is saying for him it is conflict of interest now that he is AG.  Papa, things are not working out for me, these people have hardened their hearts against me, please give me a signal.  Papa that Airforce commander you left us with at ZAF, General Chimense and James chungu of Chita lodges, the one who sponsored PF and you all the way till the last rally in Mandevu by erecting a stage where you campaigned from to form government government in 2011, both are daily customers at our courts today. I don't understand why, but I can't give you all the details now because the matters are still in the courts of law as it is  contemptuous to do so now, but I know why he was haunted out of that office after doing everything possible according to your instructions in assisting my brother President Lungu to win 2015 presidential bye- elections , continued supporting the President  till he again the crossed the 2016 election to secure a five year term of office after  which he was kicked out of the office under very suspicious flimsy allegations. But why life is like this papa , for us not to enjoy our own sweat? This is why I want you to give us a signal .  Papa ,Sunday Chanda from MMD and Antonio Morihno  Mwanza from FDD who verbally assorted and abused you and our party  are now in charge of PF media team at the expense of PF cadres media journalists,  and they have continued verbally abusing the opposition in the same way they did to us in the opposition. Papa I am now confused on why all this is happening to us. Give us a signal.  Papa, I want to confess to you today and let you know from the bottom of my heart that your successor who you refered to me as my brother in that final meeting we had with you before your departure to where you are today, after working with him I found him to be a nice man with a good heart and his wife Esther Lungu was very nice and kind to me throughout and I was very sure like you told me to look after him, I was expecting that they would also look after me in turn but till today, for three years now I have never entered state house and I have not been given reasons what wrongs I have done. Because of this on 18 October, 2018 on a day my brother president Lungu declared a public holiday for the nation to reconcile against those citizens who have wronged each other to reconcile knowingly or for unknown reasons,  I wrote to President Lungu an apology so that he forgives me for any wrong doing done unknowingly but till today he has not forgiven me but he has forgiven most of those that offended him and his party and it's government ,but I don't know why Papa this is why I am asking from you a signal. Please give me another instruction which I will take to Judge Ngoma, George Chela, Gershom Siame ,Panji Kaunda and those true green that are sidelined by this government.  Papa, your Son Mulenga Sata, Gee and the rest of the family I have no idea how they are doing but your loyal wife is still a widow as ambassador to France. Papa if you are happy with what I am reporting here then please rest in peace , but knowing you, I am very sure you are turning in your grave and you will surely give us a right signal on what next to do and I will tell everyone what instructions I get from you, of course after you first speaking to my brother President Lungu in spirit in his dreams the cries tabled here.  Papa, I want you also to know that in the government you left for someone to get a top job they have first of all insult our president, our party and our government calling it all sorts of names and then to be silenced they are given jobs instead of taking them to court for defaming the president, surely giving them top jobs in the  government you sweated for with us for 10 years, papa what do we do with these people who are here now , we berg for a signal.  Papa, finally I want to report to you that since 2002 when I met to you at the shop for Mr. Roman Krupnic at Micmar along Lumumba road whenI told you that I had a special message for you and pulled you by the hand after you asked for talk time, screaming at me and I quote "Angoni Angoni. ...! Give me talk time for my mobile phone "end of quote.  Remember, I told you that before FTJ was made president in 1989 God showed  me a vision that he was going to be the next President of Zambia and that after that vision I told my Late Brother Necodmus Ng'oma and My biological mother about that vision.  It was there at Micmar where I told you also that after President Mwanawasa was sworn in God showed me another vision where I was driving towards Long acres roundabout from intercontinental hotel  when I saw a traffic officer stop me at Longacres roundabout to allow a presidential motor carde coming from Omelo Mumba road at your house smooth passage, and then I narrated to you that after police motor cycles passed, then Police BMW escort cars passed then a presidential Mercedes Benz appeared with its windows down and who did I see? It was you inside alone heading to state house.  Then I told you that no matter what, one day you will rule Zambia . I told  you will not die before you rule Zambia.  I continued telling you that you will go through so much pain and persecution, frequenting police, DEC and even tasting jail of unbailable offences but you shouldn't worry because God take you through a leadership college  of Joseph , a favorate son of Jacob in the ancient region of Canaan in Israel . I told that eventually you will graduate into the highest office of land like it happened to Joseph who became prime minister for the Pharaoh of Ancient Egypt you too will be the president of Zambia.  I stressed the point to you that no matter what , you will one day be president of Zambia, at meeting at Micmar shop in January 2002 along Lumumba.  Papa I  want to remind you for the benefit of the readers here that as years went by I used to warn you on what would happen to you on what government security wings were going to do to you by effecting a lot of arrest , throwing you in prison and out  out of prison things happened exactly as I would have told you.   But what shocked you the most was when you were in Chimbokaila central prison in 2002 detained for trumpant charges of motor vehicle theft over a car given to you by Xavier Chungu because you were a system operative helping the system then as a consultant.   Remember one day when I went to visit you in your prison cell that I told you to say on the case currently detained for you would be aquited but you will come back to the same cell for another unbailable offence which will be as a result of the The Post Newspaper writing a headline on the front page that was going to cause government to lock you up on unbailable offence.  You then asked me to tell you how you could avoid that arrest , and I advised you that there was nothing I could advise you to avoid the arrest because it was God's programme for you, and I was just a messenger of God to tell you what God was planning for you ahead before he ushered you in the highest office of the land.  Indeed after 25 days the courts aquited you and you called me to thank me for the truth I told you of what was going to happen to you.  Then after 3 years in 2005 the post newspaper like I had prophecied on its front page carried a headline and I quote "Sata incites miners on the Copper belt to strike "end of quote.  In that strike the miners were so violent to an extent of burning cars and vehicles on the road and damaged a lot of property on the copper belt.  Then you were charged for treason and detained at chimbokaila central prison.  I then came to see you in the very cell you were previously detained for motor vehicle theft and you said to me, and I quote," Angoni freight how did you know about this arrest three years before this day , that I was going to come back to this prison cell with accurate reasons for my arrest. You demanded that I must tell you how because you were very shocked with my early warning information.  To which I told you that they would keep you in prison for two weeks ,and on the 15th day free you by entering a nolle prosque'. Then I promised to tell you how I know when you came out on the 15th day of your detaintion. Exactly on the 15th day you were taken to court and the state entered a nolle and freed you.  I am sure you remember that the same day you were released ,you came to my lodge at Kwazulu kraal resort in Chilenje with driver Philip who you later on gave a job as a driver at the ministry of chiefs when you became president of Zambia, I don't know Papa whether Philip  has been spared till this day or not.  Papa remember we sat outside on the veranda of apartment 2 at Kwazulu, while Philip sat at the bar which was run by Sam Zulu and Chileshe your two party security personal body guards at the time.  You then very inquisitively and looking very worried asked me and I quote  " Angoni freight please napapata, tell me how you were able to tell me exactly what would happen to me it happened?" You asked.  I then responded and warned you that only when you promised to keep the information to yourself because I have never revealed this power of descernment to anyone including my own relatives, my brothers, my mother and my wives to which you quickly promised not to whisper to anyone including your wife Dr.  Christine Kaseba.  After that assurance I explained to you in detail my long ancestral history that I am a black Jew, a descendant of King Solomon from a relation he had with a virgin Queen of Sheba of ancient Ethiopia who slept with King Solomon and conceived a baby boy Solomon named Menelek.  In short this Menelek was the heir to the throne of her mother and started the dynasty of Emperor till in 1972 when  Emperor Haille Selassie was last King of the black Jew monarchy a descendant of King Solomon.  I further explained to you that after 3000 years of Emperor Menelek's rule a click of the royal blood men and women started an expedition which was very common those days when people moved without passports at a time when these boundaries we have today were not there, that a click of these men and women in their hundreds started off from land of Sheba in the present day Ethiopia, crossed the land today known as Kenya, Tanzania, through to the North of Lake Malawi in present day Kalonga district into mocambique, all the way to present day Kwazulu natal. Today those black Jews are known as Nguni speaking people here in Southern Africa  mispronounced by Bembas as Ngonis in Zambia who came from Kwazulu natal with Zwangendaba as their leader and King . I talso old you that Nelson Mandela, mbeke, Zuma and Shaka Zulu were all the descendants of King Solomon through Queen of Sheba. In conclusion, I told you and asked you whether you had watched the movie Shaka Zulu to which you answered in the afirmative. I explained to you about the role of the Insang'oma in the movie to which you said you understood the role of the Insang'oma which was of advising all the Zulu Kings of God's mind guiding the Kings how they must administer their rule over the black Jews his chosen people as descendants of Abraham.  I remember explaining to you by asking you a nother question to whether you knew my Surname?  which you quickly mentioned that I was Ngoma after which I corrected you that I was not Ngoma but NG'OMA. I then explained to you that "Isa" means "of the"  in Zulu. Now since that clan of the Zulu called Ng'oma that has powers of descernment who today live in Dumaland in Present day Kwazulu Natal were called "of the" Ng'oma in Zulu language they were called  IsaNg'oma.  *In conclusion*  I explained to you that I am a descernment of that royal blood of King Solomon a "Ng'oma " and because of having the powers of descernment which you have witnessed up to this time and which you will continue to experience, you may call me IsaNg'oma whose powers of descernment you should never ignore.  From there you started calling Sangoma instead of IsaNg'oma, you again misprounced my name but I let you call me Sangoma till the day you went to be with the Lord.  But surpringly you didn't keep your promise of not revealing the information above to anyone, I came to know when you were still alive that you couldn't keep that secret to yourself but revealed to two people namely Dr.  Chileshe Mulenga current Home affairs PS and also to your then VEEP Dr. Guy Lindon Scott, because one day when you sent me to be political advisor to VEEP Scott, he told me in Chipata at Luangwa house when I had no seat, he invited me to seat on the same seat he sat and he said to me and I quote, " you high Priest of my Boss come and seat with me here "end of quote.  I was very shocked that you revealed that secret between us.  Then at Mulungushi conference where all leaders of opposition gathered to form a coalition in order to defeat the MMD RB Banda leadership you misbehaved yourself and outside the new Hall as you sat on a rock puffing a cigarette, at the time Dr.  Chileshe Mulenga was the Acting Secretary general of PF and I was far watching you, then I saw him approach me saying to me and I quote " Dr.  Ngoma please come and help us by talking to your friend Sata, because look he is misbehaving there,  it only you he can listen from" I asked Dr.  Mulenga why it was only me he could listen to? to which he said he, President Sata confessed to us during a meeting one day and he said and I quote ," that there is only one person I would not ignore his advice, it is Dr.  Edgar Ng'oma, Angoni freight a sangoma, because what ever he advises will remain true and helpful to our cause and if you do not take heed whatever happens to you it is your own fault" ended Dr.  Mulenga.  I then walked to where Mr. Sata was seated on a rock and whispered in his ears and I quote " Mr.  President this behaviour you have exhibited is uncalled for, I know you don't want to be in coalition with any party in order to defeat the MMD, but you can refuse in a sober manner by going inside the hall". To the satisfaction of Dr.  Mulenga President Sata immediately stood up and straight went in the where president Nevers Mumba of NCC party was, BY Mwila ZRP Party and late Ken Ngondo PP party . Then Dr. Mulenga came to me and said thank so much Sangoma, then I knew you didn't keep  our secret.  Why I told you to keep it as a secret the powers of descernment from revealing to anyone because of the information of what was made known to me which I couldn't  share with you then and which I cannot still share with anyone today reading this Xmas message.  But Papa ,when you gave me an instruction to look after President Lungu 21 days before you went to be with the Lord, while you were in London I told president Lungu that you were not going to return alive from the hospital you had gone to London  and that he Lungu would  be the next President of Zambia after you, and quickly I turned to my sister in law Esther Lungu  and I told her that "you Mulamu in 100 days from now you will be the first lady of Zambia,"  and these are the two reactions I got from President Lungu and now the first lady his wife Madam Esther Lungu. I quote" My brother don't say that because  President Sata is still president and nothing will happen to him he will return and continue to be the President of Zambia to which I objected and told him that no, president Sata when he called us in that office you and me and told me and never said anything to you, looking straight at me and he said, Sangoma from today don't report to this office, report to Lungu's because I want you to help Lungu to see you through to the mamoath task laying ahead of you because he knew and said with you Sangoma around, Lungu will be guided properly to get to his destination " end of quote.  So I reminded  My brother Lungu at his Lewanika close home behind state house these instructions you had given me.  Then, Mulamu Madam Esther Lungu's reaction was in venacular language Nyanja and she said I quote " Aah  !Mulamu osa kamba so, ise tingakhale a First lady ise?  A first lady baliko ba Dr.  Christine Kaseba ! to which I responded without wasting time, and told both of them president Lungu and his wife that " Dr.  Kaseba would be the former first lady after your husband here (me pointing a finger at brother Lungu, )is president, you will be the mother of Zambia and you will look after all of us " End of quote.  Papa today these two I have never visited them at their new house called Nkwazi house where you were living , I don't know why.  From rumours I heard that Kaiser Zulu and Emmanuel Chilubanama told President Lungu that I was a confused fellow and I should not be given any job in his government after carrying my assignment diligently without any mistake in the 2014.  In that task around President Lungu I had four critical roles to do after your dimise  1. The brand director to the president.  2. Image builder.  3. Political advisor.  4.  Social media Assistant to President Lungu.  After a successful delivery of a new President to Zambia in 2015 till today I am languishing. For example today 25th December 2019 I am stuck with no food at home, no fuel.  But Papa those who were insulting you are in full swing celebrations today  party after party when me and your cadres are hungry without food. please papa I know clearly their fate, if they do not listen to what I will advise President Lungu before the end of this year, there is going to be no option but spend most of their retirement from their political life in correctional prisons across the country to produce maize to feed the nation.  Papa please give us a signal because if you are happy with what is happening to us and you choose to keep quiet, God has already provided and given me option B and I will instruct all your people to follow me where I will take them.

Two months ago, President Edgar Lungu informed the nation that some of his cabinet Ministers are corrupt thieves who are embezzling huge sums of taxpayers' money. The president said that he could not take the corruption and theft within his cabinet anymore and assured the nation that he would soon fire those thieves. It's now over two months and nothing has happened, yet the theft and corruption has continued unabated. It was all woof woof woof and no bite. 2. The other week and this last one, the President travelled to Luapula and Eastern Provinces. There, he expressed displeasure that up to now many farmers have not yet received farming inputs. He lumped the blame on banks and agro-dealers for this catastrophic delay. It's sad that the President is playing politics with people's lives when he knows so well that farmers have not received inputs because his Government has failed to pay the agro-dealers for the farming inputs hence these suppliers have refused to supply farming inputs to farmers. Why not raise the money and pay the suppliers rather than moving up and down talking to desperate farmers and pretend that you are unaware of the causes of this debacle? The President and his Ministers have been singing that they will priotise Agriculture as the main hub for economic recovery and national prosperity but they have completely neglected Agriculture. They have failed to put money in Agriculture. There is no money for inputs, mechanised production, irrigation, agro-processing and diversification. It's been all woof woof woof and no action. 3. While in Luapula, the President threatened to fire his cabinet Ministers who have neglected their constituencies. Really? Firstly this is the same President who rejected the people's submissions that Ministers should be appointed from outside Parliament to ensure among other things, the separation of powers and efficiency so that MPs concentrate on their primary responsibility of legislating and Ministers concentrate on their primary responsibility of policy formulation. Why is the President failing to act on incompetent Ministers and instead he is always threatening to fire them but he has no courage to act. Again it's woof woof woof and no bite. 4. Last month, Government went to town announcing that Mealie Meal prices will be reduced by 2nd February. Today is 12th February. Even a child who is doing Shosho Studies oh sorry Social Studies knows that prices of goods and services are influenced by market forces and not propaganda. This Government is well aware that we are in this mess because of their own actions and policies: how can the price of Mealie Meal go down when the cost of production has skyrocketed? How can Mealie Meal prices go down when we have a shortfall of over 200, 000 metric tonnes from our target strategic reserves of 500, 000 and mealers are not accessing cheap maize from FRA as a result of this shortage. We corruptly exported 100, 000 metric tonnes of maize to Malawi when we had not met our reserves. Why is Government failing to concentrate on finding lasting solutions to the ever rising cost of doing business instead of feeding us this hogwash? 5. In this country it seems elections don't end. If we are not talking about the 2016 elections then we are talking about the 2021 elections. We have serious socio-economic challenges that needs our conceited effort and attention but we are all spending immense periods of time talking elections. There is a time for everything. 6. It is abundantly evident that Government is in total disarray, it's pure Chipante-pante. It seems that our brothers and sisters in the corridors of power have neither the clue nor the acumen to formulate and implement sound policies. With the current fiscal deficits, power deficits, high cost of production, rising national debt, dwindling revenue collections, a valueless Kwacha we need a cadre of men and women who can formulate and implement sound policies. We need to cut down on unnecessary government expenditure and concentrate on production. The President must take a serious self introspection and evaluate and access his team. We have no shortage of brains and patriots in this country. The President has four years to turn things around and he can do it if he can commit himself.

In a letter obtained by Daily Revelation, dated December 17, 2019 addressed to the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) director general, and filed with the Commission’s offices in Chipata, Col Panji stated that efforts to get Lands and Environmental Protection minister Kapata and her permanent secretary Yumba to act on the matter had proved futile, despite meeting and formally complaining to them. “Early this year we noticed that (the approximately 3790 hectares) Forest P70 also known as Chimutengo Forest in Sinda District is being fenced off. What was of interest to us was that the fencing had included a private farm allegedly owned by Miss Tasila Lungu, and gates had been erected at the entrances of both the private land and the main gate of the forest,” the letter read in part. “We made inquiries with the forest department in Chipata under whose jurisdiction the said forest falls, we wanted to know if permission was given and who had fenced off both properties.” Col Panji stated that at the time inquiries were made, no official permission had been issued by the Forestry Department on the said erection of the fence, and that efforts to stop the construction had been ignored, despite the officials failing to state publicly the name of the person behind the project. “Through various press statements from newslines, we hear it is allegedly Miss Tasila Lungu who owns this project, but up to today there is no official confirmation on the same,” the letter read in part. “In early October, we wrote to the Minister of Lands Jean Kapata seeking an explanation from the Ministry as to how the said had been fenced off which included a privately owned farm and also as to who was responsible for the project (copy attached).” Col Panji, however, stated that, to date there has been no response from the Ministry acknowledging receipt of the letters of complaint on the matter. “Later in November, driving into Lusaka, we noticed Bill Boards (three) one at each end of the fence and another at the main entrance of the forest. We went and made inquiries as to who had erected these boards, that gave the impression that the fencing was done by the government as they showed logos of the Forest Department, USAID and government,” Col Panji stated. “We went to see the department of forestry in Lusaka and were told that the report had been submitted to Ministry headquarters. We saw the Permanent Secretary Lands and he told us ‘They do not work on rumours.’ We wrote to him on or around 15th November, 2019 attaching the photographs of each Board (copies attached). When they were called to follow up, we were told they were looking into the matter.” Col Panji said all the possible avenues to get clarification on the matter had been unsuccessful, hence the decision to write to the Commission. “It is an offence for anyone to enter a forest without authority or permit according to the forestry act, and that anyone found breaking this law is bound to be punished,” Col Panji stated. “The fence did not come up overnight it took months to finish and everyone who has driven past the forest including the local community should have seen it, including the officers from the forestry department.” Col Panji wondered why the the project was allowed to continue to its completion when no authority was given. “Why has the the Ministry of Lands remained silent on such an important public matter despite our queries and that of the press. Officially the Ministry has not acknowledged as to who owns this project leading to public speculations. What is it that they are hiding from the public?” asked Col Panji. “It is against the above background that we seek the help of your good offices, to help us and indeed the public find answers to the above questions. Lastly, this is a very expensive exercise, we would like to also know how this project was funded, and if all regulations concerning investors were followed.

A week ago, there was a story associated with the Berlin-based Transparency International alleging that the organization was calling for an investigation in the Mukula tree, and yesterday, it was the Africa Development Bank alleged to have placed on Zambia sanctions due to its alleged failure to settle loans. These two examples are the most recent. Otherwise, the list is long. No one likes to be lied to and therefore no one should accept telling lies as a legitimate form of communication. If there is anyone that would justify telling lies as a form of legitimate communication, sooner or later, they will be made to taste their own medicine – it really hurts! Here is my suggested response. Gone are the days when information was the monopoly of  only a few people. Today, not even traditional media organizations or security agencies or experts on any subject can claim exclusive access to information. This is because every kind of information is readily available online thereby making fake news an outdate form of political communication and campaign. When the fake story of Transparency International allegedly calling for an investigation into Zambia on Mukula went online, it only took me a few minutes to go to the TI website and found that the only document referring to Zambia was a report uploaded in October which was a study of four countries whose forest management systems were studied and lessons learnt shared with the rest of Africa in the hope that they may seal any possible gaps of potential corruption. In the case of ADB, the approach was the same. I went online immediately and found that on the very day the fake story alleged Zambia was blacklisted by the ADB – 02.12.2019, a contract was being awarded for water and sanitation projects in Kasama and Mbala using ADB loans! So, it is futile to use tools that have been overtaken by technology and expect that they will have the intended effects. What those of us disinterested in fake news must be doing is always immediately counter them by dumping on the same platform credible news and information. It is an insult to the intelligence of the Zambian people to think that they have no access to other sources of news and information. Secondly, it is a huge disservice to a client or candidate you work for if they continue paying for a shoddy PR job because of using tools that are out of date. In the information age, clients will need very smart Public Relations experts to package and communicate their campaign messages. And being a liar is not being smart at all. ZWD RESPONSE: We don’t know if Kellys Kaunda actually knows how to use the Internet or whether he follows events in Zambia or he is busy with prostitutes as usual.

Bishops, politicians, international dignitaries in the form of Barones Scotland and one Professor Bangari including peasants have all been talking about the need for HH and ECL to dialogue and reconcile. Months have come and months have gone and all we hear about this so called dialogue between HH and ECL is from what the two leaders and their functionaries in the press and social media have been pandering but a meeting between these two leaders is fast becoming a pipedream. To begin with, if there must be reconciliation, there must be truth and justice. You can't keep peace by force, manipulation or falsehoods. Like Izzeldin Abuelaish once remarked, you cannot ask people to coexist by having one side bow their heads and agree to a solution that is only good for one side. If there must be reconciliation, there must be truth, fairness and justice. As we talk about this so called dialogue and reconciliation there is need to be very clear of the connotations and implications of these words and processes. To begin with, reconciliation assumes that there has been a breakdown in the relationship, but now there has been a change from a state of enmity and fragmentation to one of harmony and fellowship. The animosity or conflict between HH and ECL does not stem from personal differences but electoral and general governance issues; after all HH and ECL have never been friends in the first place so there is nothing form them to reconcile about at a personal level. The animosity between these two Zambians is stemming from the electoral battle of 2016 and what has been transpiring since politically so if anyone wants the two to reconcile then any effort or dialogue must be focused on the causes of the conflict and not generalities. For HH and ECL to genuinely reconcile then the following have to be honestly and openly be addressed: 1. The electoral process, that is the management of 2016 elections vis-a-vis the conduct of the Electoral Commission of Zambia. 2. The application of the Public Order Act 3. The Electoral Process Act No.35 of 2016 and the Constitutional lacunas that have contributed to having chaotic and frankly speaking, shambolic elections 4. The conduct of the police and other institutions of governance eg the Judiciary, the Anti Corruption Commission and the public media. 5. The state of human rights and the rule of law among others. All these issues need to be addressed head on and progressive reforms have to be made in order to achieve peace and the so called reconciliation. So far there seems to be nothing practical or tangible being done to bring both HH and ECL to a round table. All we see and hear are accusations and counter accusations of breaches and lack of commitment to dialogue by both parties. Unless serious efforts are quickly made for the two conflicting leaders to meet and discuss, this story of dialogue and reconciliation will soon lose meaning and will be overtaken by events. Remember, life does not allow vacuums. By Antonio Mwanza,267,243,14,2,5,1,2,74,2901741593209905,/story.php?story_fbid=2901741593209905&id=129987587052000

This follows a Board and Management decision to abandon the NAPSA pension scheme over an insurance scheme obtained from a private insurance company, Madison Insurance. Zambia Daily Mail  Management has phased out retirement conditions of service for both unionised and middle management staff resulting in almost all middle management staff opting to leave the company immediately. The phasing out of retirement conditions of service take effect on 31st December. This is to pave way for the implementation of the newly-introduced Madison Insurance Scheme. On accrued terminal benefits as of 31st December, Management is expected to transfer employees’ terminal benefits to Madison Insurance Company over a period of 10 years.

Thus, President Lungu is crookedly using the Christian posture to steal gold in the name of God; but he must remember the story of Anania and Saphilar in the Bible. Chris Zumani Zimba Below is the article that Zimba wrote STEALING STATE GOLD IN THE NAME OF GOD: THE CASE OF PRESIDENT EDGAR LUNGU IN ZAMBIA By: Chris Zumani Zimba, a Political Scientist, Author, PhD Scholar, Lecturer and Consultant Africa is still underdeveloped and suffering from absolute poverty. This is not news in Togo, Nigeria, Somalia, Sudan, Zambia, Cameroon, DR Congo, Zimbabwe, South Africa, Algeria, Ghana, Senegal, Ethiopia, Burundi, Egypt, Mozambique, Kenya, Mali, Chad, Uganda or Angola. One of the key reasons for this dark reality is rampant corruption as political leaders loot and plunder public resources with impunity. In many instances, these corrupt African leaders steal public resources while presenting themselves as children of God and devoted believers. In Zambia, President Edgar Lungu, his government and party officials present a classical example of how to steal state gold (public resources) in the name of God as follows: While claiming to be a law abiding citizen and Christian, Lungu has started campaigning for 2021, an act which is against electoral laws and regulations by printing and distributing more than 6,000,000 school books branded with his portrait countrywide. While the PF have justified this project, the Zambia Civic Education Association (ZCEA) has denounced the act by calling it “a mischievous form of charlatanism and the worst form of exploitation to use vulnerable, helpless and hopeless children to advance one’s political hegemony”. Ironically, no one knows the sources of funding for this huge presidential project. Although he promised to empower the poor as a Christian himself in his inauguration Speech on 13th September 2016, Lungu has mainly empowered himself. For example, while he declared to be worth K2.5 million in January 2015 to the Electoral Commission of Zambia (ECZ), Lungu declared to be worth over K23 million in July, 2016 before the Presidential and General Elections. Lungu’s ‘miracle wealth’ came as a shock among fellow Christians as the President’s monthly salary is only K36,000 and he was not known to be into any serious business. Despite laying a foundation for the construction of a state Christian cathedral in Woodlands as a Christian leader, Lungu is alleged to be working with the ‘corrupt Guptas Family’ which has captured the State- a Chinese Construction firm awarded most contracts to build major roads and public infrastructure countrywide. In return, this Chinese company is allegedly building luxury houses, flats, casinos, hotels, lodges, etc for President Lungu and his officials as a token of appreciation. Although he has the controversial Ministry of Religious Affairs (practically Ministry of Christianity) with an ordained Church Reverend as its Cabinet Minister, Lungu seems to cherish corruption and does not suspend or fire any of his appointees on this merit. For example, President Lungu took no punitive actions against the Minister and Permanent Secretary for the Ministry of Education when they publicly apologized before the Parliamentary Accounts Committee in 2017 for spending over K2. 7 million to purchase one vehicle for the minister and office furniture. While defending the Christian Declaration and values as provided in the Republican Constitution, on 10th February, 2018, President Lungu openly encouraged civil servants to continue engaging in theft by public servant when he said: “ubomba mwibala alila mwibala”- meaning “he who works in the cornfield eats what is in the cornfield” i.e. officially introducing kleptocracy (rule by theft) in Zambia. Lungu is also alleged to be involved in the illegal export of lucrative Mukula with his daughter and State House officials. He has also created the Presidential Empowerment Fund, a parallel structure that is donating unaudited funds to marketeers and churches in his name while no one knows who funds it, how, where, why and when. While he officially declared October 18 as a Public Holiday – National Day of Prayers and Reconciliation in order to uphold Christianity, Lungu’s government approved the controversial public procurement deal – the 42 fire trucks purchased at $1m each (K10, 000,000) and insured at $25,000 (K250,000), totaling U$52.5 million per unit. In trying to show solidarity with the Christian poor, Lungu publicly denounced the legal provision of being a beneficiary of the former president house entitlement. To the contrary, President Lungu, in 2017 endorsed another corrupt procurement deal of 50 ambulances at $288,000 each amounting to over $11 million (K110,000,000) in total while Toyota (Zambia), a globally renowned car manufacturer and dealer, submitted a quotation to supply the same items at about $70,000 each but was allegedly turned down”. While Lungu promised to govern Zambia on pro poor policies as a Christian, his ‘Christian government’ has done the opposite – increased PAYE to 37.5%, introduction of estate levy, road toll fees, proposed national health taxes, increased fuel and electricity tariffs, among others. While Lungu promised to govern Zambia on pro poor policies as a Christian, his ‘Christian government’ has done the opposite; increased PAYE to 37.5%, landlord withholding tax, road toll fees, fuel levy, road tax, proposed national health taxes, increased fuel and electricity tariffs among others.

This follows the poor 2018/19 season, during which widespread drought resulted in poor agricultural production and deteriorated livestock conditions.  These trends are compounded by flooding and conflict in DRC and very poor macroeconomic conditions in Zimbabwe.  The population expected to face Crisis or worse outcomes across Southern Africa through the March 2020 peak of the lean season will be well above average, and needs are expected to only rise further in late 2020, at the start of the next lean season.  Donors and humanitarian partners should prepare for atypically high food assistance needs throughout 2020.    Large-scale crop losses occurred at the end of the 2018/19 Regional maize grain supply for the current marketing year is slightly below the five-year average, reaching their lowest levels since the 2016/17 marketing year. As a result, maize prices are significantly above average across the region. Many poor agropastoral households depleted their food stocks atypically early, resulting in earlier than usual reliance on market purchases. The start of the 2019/20 rainy season has been erratic, with early season deficits, and international forecasts are all indicating January to March 2020 rainfall is expected to be below average.  Recent heavy rainfall over areas of South Africa, Botswana, Namibia, and Angola lessened but did not eliminate early season deficits. Regional pasture and vegetative conditions have improved gradually with recent rains, though livestock body conditions are well below normal. Planting is ongoing, although at below average rates due to erratic onset of rains. The combination of atypically high food prices coupled with limited incomes (from low livestock prices and agricultural labor opportunities) have reduced household purchasing power. Rainfall during the December to March period is critical for crop development and likely below-average rainfall is expected to have negative impacts on rainfed crops, pasture, and water availability. Irrigated crops are also expected to be negatively impacted due to the multiple years of poor rainfall that have resulted in below-average groundwater levels. Late season rainfall may be average but would only slightly reduce cumulative rainfall deficits and potentially improve water and pasture availability, while having no significant impact on crop production. Below-average production is anticipated in Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, Zambia, and Zimbabwe, and average to below-average production is likely in South Africa and Mozambique. Since Zambia and South Africa produce more than 70 percent of regional maize grain, regional maize grain supply for the 2020/21 marketing year is expected to be below 2019/20 and the five-year average. As a result, maize grain prices across the region in 2020 are anticipated to remain high and exceeding 2019 prices. Lower than average access to labor opportunities are anticipated throughout 2020. Livestock body conditions are anticipated to improve in the short term as pastureland slowly regenerates, although grazing conditions are expected to deteriorate atypically early. Higher than average livestock deaths are again anticipated in the latter half of 2020 until the start of the 2020/21 rainy season. These trends, coupled with above-average staple food prices, will limit poor households’ ability to purchase sufficient food to meet their needs across much of the region. The exceptions include northern Madagascar and northern and central Mozambique and Malawi where average to above average rainfall is anticipated to support normal,393,257,1,1,7,124,3,158,2900586773325387,/story.php?story_fbid=2900586773325387&id=129987587052000

The State Department is “dismayed” with Zambia for having effectively declared Foote a persona non grata, it said in an emailed statement. The U.S. government strongly opposes abuses against sexual minorities, it said, without confirming Foote’s withdrawal. The dispute started after Foote said he was “horrified” after a Zambian court last month sentenced two men to 15 years imprisonment for having consensual sex while corrupt officials steal millions in public funds and walk free. Zambian President Edgar Lungu responded by saying he wanted Foote to leave the country. The U.S. provides Zambia with about $500 million in annual aid.

While i laud President Edgar Chagwa Lungu for finally taking action though tard against his immediate past advisor Kaizer Zulu who has not been short of scandals and appointing a political rookie in Chris Zumani Zimba, i take a swipe at the new appointee even with his brilliant resume and political untaintedness. A check on Chris Zimba's Facebook page which he immediately shut down after his appointment reveals a man of standing who clearly opposed the president and his government, citing among the many things violence and high levels of corruption in it but who has apparently accepted an appointment from the same violent and corrupt regime he was antagonizing just a few weeks ago. Chris Zimba's great resume and his ability to handle his new role of presidential advisor aside, i have questions for him. What has changed positively about the current government and its leadership that he would join it without shame after openly disparaging it? Is it PF that has changed or he has changed? Should we trust his moral standing and judge him for his lack of principles and consistency seeing how quick he has flipflopped to join the very people he recently called corrupt and violent? Could it be that the Patriotic Front is not as bad as many portray it to be when they are far from the corridors of power only to laud it when they are appointed as was the case with Antonio Mwanza, Geofrey Bwalya Mwamba and now Chris Zimba? Like many other people we see, watch and read about who oppose anything Patriotic Front who should not be trusted, Chris Zimba should not be trusted as he was playing a game to be noticed and has achieved his goal. He was opposing the government of the day merely to oppose it and can now sit comfortably while those that followed him thinking he was a principled man remain disappointed. A lesson for Zambian political followers, never support or follow anyone simply because he/she opposes what you oppose as many have self beneficial motives for doing so and will disappoint you when they switch sides as is the case now.

The Government through RDA has been giving out contracts for various works related to Roads. These include building Roads, periodic mentance and other related works. However, it is very difficult to get payments from NRFA.  One wonders why NRFA does not pay us contractors on time because it is getting money every single second that passes around the country through toll gates. Why does the government use this money meant to pay us the contractors that are maintaining these Roads, which these toll gates are always getting revenue, which this revenue was intended for? Some of us have not been paid for works as far as February but we are expected to continue to work. Our workers get paid from the same money that we get paid from NRFA.  What is more annoying is that NRFA does not even want to tell us when we are being paid. The do not want to meet us and always avoiding us, making us look like we are a burden on their lives and yet it is them that are a burden. This is now Christmas and thousands of families that are dependent on this industry will go hungry because toll fees are being used for other things. NRFA goes ahead in announcing the millions the are collecting, but are failing to pay the people that help in the road management.  It is time that NRFA publishes the expenditure on which this money is being utilized for. Come on people, let us get paid so that we can put a blessing on the plates of thousands of our employees table that are dependent on road construction and maintenance.

From the time Danny Carlow officially resigned from Glencore, an unexplainable number of resignations have rocked Mopani. There has also been motivated attacks on Zambian Management. PF officials  Alexander Chiteme, Binwell Mpundu, Nathan Chanda and Christorpher Kangombe who are benefiting from the contracts at Mopani Mine have been paid with supply contracts to keep quiet and have so far failed to expose the rot. Mopani Chairman Moses Chilangwa has  also failed to protect the Zambian managers that are being fired. Mopani Management have also thrown to the wind Corporate Governance as the Bazungu at the Glencore Office in Johannesburg have disregarded the basic requirements of the tenets. Ever since the Führer, Fabian Matheis who is the Chancellor of the South African Glencore Reich working out of the Glencore Head Office in Rosebank, Johannesburg took over Mopani has taken a dramatic u-turn and is headed for a Konkola Copper Mine. Resignations that have occurred include, Chief Executive Officer Chris Vermeulen, Chief Financial Officer Mr. John Chiwele and at least 15 other senior management officials.  This excludes the list of those that have been constructively dismissed.  Former CEO Chris Vermeulen was fired because he was considered too sympathetic to the indigenous black employees and suppliers.  Former CFO John Chiwele has been hounded out because he has been very instrumental in employing Zambians to critical positions within the mine as well as replacing foreign suppliers with local ones.  In their place Fabian Matheis has since appointed a puppet called Nathan Bullock, as Chief Executive Officer and a tourist for a Chief Financial Officer called Neal Reynolds.  Nathan is considered a Puppet because he cannot make a decision to save his life or the life of the mine for that matter.  Neal is considered a Tourist because he flies into Zambia for work on Tuesday and flies back to South Africa every Friday evening.  In the six months since Fabian Matheis took over as CEO, he has failed to manage the Smelter Shutdown in Mufulira.  That smelter is the heart of Mopani operations. So far he has spent over $60 million dollars or more on refurbishing the smelter.  However,  information has emerged that every major contracts on this project were single sourced from Fabian Matheis’s cronies in South Africa and Australia.  Management recently spent $900,000 to pay an Australian company for “cultural exchange” which really has got nothing to do with copper. Ivan Glasenberg the Glenore CEO employs unscrupulous people like Fabian Matheis to manage his operations in Zambia and the DRC.  This fire or force any progressive Zambian that can challenge their authority to resign.  They rob Glencore clean and blame the Zambians as corrupt, dull and incompetent.  It is feared that after these pundits are done robbing Glencore, the mine goes into care and maintenance as Government starts to desperately look for an investor and every Zambian on the Copperbelt is left with yet another defunct mine.,98,87,3,,1,5,2,31,2899541633429901,/story.php?story_fbid=2899541633429901&id=129987587052000

This excitement is derived from the dismissal of Kaizer Zulu by President Edgar Lungu as his political advisor on Wednesday. Mukwita currently in the country on Christmas holiday has been heard telling his inner circle of play boys such as fired ECZ Director of Elections Chomba Chella that Kaizer deserved to be kicked out of the presidency. "KZ deserved to be shown the door. He should have been gone way back," he is quoted as saying. "What is shocking is that even with his big nose, Kaizer's nostrils could still not smell the coffee. He messed up boss man big time. With the loss of power, Im seeing cops picking him up for various assault cases, abductions and dirty deals hatched using the name of the President. The guy is gone and gone for good never to come back," he went on to add.  It is the same Mukwita who Kaizer would give pocket money after he lost his job at the Daily Mail as Managing Director. When Mukwita fell on hard times and reverted to drinking cheap lagers, his current wife Ellen had left him to join her parents. She only reappeared after he got a diplomatic job.

He used to encourage us when people like KZ and Amos ignored us. I have so much respect for him, though like any of us he has his weaknesses. Read what he has to say on this issue. Dr.  Edgar Ng'oma -political commentator/analyst I am entitled to my opinion, kindly respect wrong or right.  KZ had made numerous mistakes to the public but he never failed in his job for the party and it's government. He worked well for the party and he was the most loyal official to the party and its president.  I worked with KZ and I know how he, Chilubanama and I  helped President Lungu ascend to power,at a time when people did not believe in President Lungu taking turns in calling him all sorts of names at the time.  Guy Lindon Scot withdrew the government security details and machinery from Lungu so that he could never ascend to power , but Kaiser and current ADC Chanda who has been the body guard since president sata died till today were the two people who guarded president Lungu 24/7.   They made sure they checked where he slept , what he was going to eat, drink,  who he was talking with and what type of transport he was going to use.  Kaiser did all this alone with the help of ADC Chanda when the state never believed in Lungu and never took care of President Lungu . Ask me in my inbox I will explain more how Guy Scott tortured president Lungu because I was with President Lungu 24/7 after the death of President Sata.  While KZ was doing all this I was charged with the responsibility of branding the president, image building,political advisor and a social media assistant to president Lungu with my social media coined Chagwa special coverage capturing every moment live, to make sure you all knew where president Lungu was and what he was saying in the 2015 bye elections campaigns.  For me here, loyalty and experience of the job was very crucial in the replacement of KZ before looking at academic qualifications.  KZ has never failed his job as an advisor but failed in handling  his social affairs.  I wish Kaiser Zulu all the best because his dismissal will leave a big gap which has not been filled by the replacement of Zamani Zimba, it a few grains of sand in the pit.  My analysis. END.......

From the same Bible and political point of view, we also know that: (1) the declaration makes Zambians either holy sinners or wicked saints; (2) the declaration is a political gimmick to appease the Evangelical zealous voters; (3) the declaration era of MMD saw more poverty and suffering than secularism era of UNIP; (4) declaration era of MMD introduced and worsened corruption in Zambia; (5) the ‘Christian Declaration’ is an assault of logic; (6) the declaration is not the reason for peace in Zambia; (7) the declaration was proclaimed by a crooked politician ; (8) the declaration is now the dividing factor among Zambian Christians; (9) the declaration is suitable for ‘theocracies’ and not ‘liberal democracies’; (10) the declaration has the potential for the President to impose his personal faith as State Religion; and (12) the declaration was a unilateral proclamation without public outcry or approval. In conclusion, we need to stress that while it is very difficult to find clean drinking water in many parts of Zambia, it is still mythical to note that alcohol and casual sex have traditionally and increasingly become the easiest and cheapest commodities that one can speedily access anywhere in this Christian nation. The Christian declaration is generally a misplaced political proclamation and falls short of being a good yardstick and source of inspiring public policies and legislations in a country that aspires to be a model liberal democracy unless we want Zambia to become a theocracy like Iran or Saudi Arabia. We need to decide to either have our current democracy or go theocratic because we cannot have both. For now, Zambia remains a plastic Christian nation with all forms of godliness but without the power of holiness and God thereof given that it is also a ripe brothel state, typical alcohol republic, approved superstitious empire and overly corrupt kingdom in the region.

This proverb is commonly used among Bemba people to justify pilferage i.e. “he who works in the cornfield eats what is in the cornfield” just like their Ngoni tribal cousins would say “Walya kake aliye mulandu” as earlier observed. In practical terms, President Lungu did not only justify abuse of public resources in the civil service, ‘Eagle One’ simply articulated a new public policy in Zambian governance by authorizing ‘kleptocracy’- (rule by theft) under the famous auspices of “ubomba mwibala alila mwibala”. Clearly, this statement is enough ground for the Zambian law makers to initiate and advance a vote of no confidence in Lungu as President as well  On 10th February, 2018 during a PF fundraising dinner in Ndola, President Edgar Lungu made a shocking public announcement in defending the increasing corruption allegations against him, his Cabinet ministers, permanent secretaries, chief executives of state agencies and PF senior officials, when he noted in a Bemba proverb that “ubomba mwibala alila mwibala”. This proverb is commonly used among Bemba people to justify pilferage i.e. “he who works in the cornfield eats what is in the cornfield” just like their Ngoni tribal cousins would say “Walya kake aliye mulandu” as earlier observed. In practical terms, President Lungu did not only justify abuse of public resources in the civil service, ‘Eagle One’ simply articulated a new public policy in Zambian governance by authorizing ‘kleptocracy’- (rule by theft) under the famous auspices of “ubomba mwibala alila mwibala”. Clearly, this statement is enough ground for the Zambian law makers to initiate and advance a vote of no confidence in Lungu as President as well as start all the necessary political processes for his eventual impeachment due to the following reasons:   President Lungu must be reminded that Zambia is not a monarchy, with a royal king, born to rule in whichever way he wants and later die in old age on the throne with his child as a known heir to the highest political office. Zambia is a constitutional democracy, governed by written laws with an elected leader who is a temporal political servant of the people; with the people having the full sovereign powers to define and determine the conduct and tenure of their temporal leader.  Based on the solid constitutional basis of this sovereign republic called Zambia, President Lungu’s “ubomba mwibala alila mwibala” public announcement of justifying ‘kleptocracy’ makes him the number one political, legal and moral enemy of the Zambian people, the presidency and the supreme law of the land as he now stands very unfit and misplaced to continue being the Head of State and Government.   Article 108, (1) (a), (b) and (c), which provides for the impeachment of the President in the Constitution of Zambia (Amendment) No. 2 of 2016 evidently states that (1) A Member of Parliament, supported by at least one-third of the Members of Parliament, may move a motion for the impeachment of the President alleging that the President has committed— (a) a violation of a provision of this Constitution or other law; (b) a crime under international law; or (c) gross misconduct.   What President Lungu said in Ndola constitutes gross misconduct under Article 108 (1) (c) for someone who is Head of State and Government as well as Commander of the Armed Forces. One common definition of gross misconduct states that “it is an act which is so serious that it justifies dismissal without notice, or pay in lieu of notice, for a first offence. They must be acts that destroy the relationship of trust and confidence between the employer and employee, making the working relationship impossible to continue”. In “ubomba mwibala alila mwibala”, President Lungu crossed the acceptable political redline of misconduct as no sane elected leader can have the immoral courage to openly insult the poor people he/she governs by officially introducing and justifying rampart abuse of their resources in the civil service as President Lungu tried to do in Ndola. In this proverb, it is clear that ‘Eagle One’ committed gross misconduct, an impeachable offence under Zambian laws to which President Lungu should not be exempted or protected.   President Lungu’s statement in Ndola is an official introduction and recognition of  ‘kleptocracy’ (rule by theft) in Zambia as was the case in former Zaire under Mobutu Sese Seko. According to the Cambridge Dictionary, Kleptocracy is “a society whose leaders make themselves rich and powerful by stealing from the rest of the people they govern”.  By accepting and promoting kleptocracy in “ubomba mwibala alila mwibala”, President Lungu violated article 92 (1) of the Republican Constitution on the ‘Executive functions of President’ which states that (1) “The President shall perform, with dignity, leadership and integrity, the acts that are necessary and expedient for, or reasonably incidental to, the exercise of the executive authority”. In line with Article 108 (1), (a) as cited above, this is a serious violation the Zambian Constitution.   Thus, President Lungu’s open crusade to call upon civil servants and politicians countrywide to continue stealing tax payers moneys and abuse public is politically immorally, malicious and a serious abrogation of our constitutional values and principles of the public service. President Lungu’s “ubomba mwibala alila mwibala” approach to governance violates 173. Values and principles of public service (1) The guiding values and principles of the public service include the following— (a) maintenance and promotion of the highest standards of professional ethics and integrity; (b) promotion of efficient, effective and economic use of national resources; (c) effective, impartial, fair and equitable provision of public services;”…   This makes him politically ripe for the National Assembly to immediately move an impeachment motion as they resume sitting this month. Should UPND and independent MPs as well as objective PF lawmakers fail to move an impeachment motion in the next parliamentary sitting, then our lawmakers will be in agreement with President Lungu, that ‘Kleptocracy’ is the new acceptable order of the day in Zambian governance and civil service while the existing Zambian constitution must be thrown out or burnt. But the PF officials and all well-meaning Zambian MPs have South Africa’s ANC to emulate for recalling and retiring President Jacob Zuma untimely due to loss of public confidence in his leadership born out of rampart corruption scandals. Therefore, when Lungu says “ubomba mwibala alila mwibala”, he becomes a bad living testimony and wrong role model for all civil servants and politicians as he seems to be walking the talk of “Walya kake aliye mulandu”, meaning, ‘he who eats what is his does not commit any wrong’. But we know that Zambia is not for Lungu; not his personal maize field for him to get whatever, whenever and however he wants.   In conclusion, it is important to stress that “ubomba mwibala alila mwibala” is an immoral governance model that must be pragmatically ejected by all morally upright sovereign citizens; President Lungu must not impose ‘kletocracy’ as an acceptable and normal corruption practice in the civil service.  If democracy and good governance are to be consolidated and sustained, the powers are now left in the hands of all well-meaning Zambians to denounce and reject both the ideology and its ideologist. And this cannot become real as long as President Lungu is not impeached on this evil political merit. There is need to immediately start the impeachment motion of this elected political leader so that, for God’s sake, free Zambian citizens stand up and refuse to be treated as his personal subjects or his chiefdom political slaves. This is where the country’s religious leaders i.e. bishops, priests, prophets as well as political parties and good governance or human rights civil society organizations (CSOs) terribly betray the Zambian poor and voters when they go corruptly mute. In all moral fairness, Lungu must be recalled to the community and legally removed as he falls below the political belt to continue as an elected leader.

ObjectId("5e0ca44f4c36d57ff9611c34"),Zambian Watchdog,,2019-12-21 22:22:35,Lungu is annoying PF members by appointing MMD officials  By  Chris Zumani Zimba on April 27, 2018 By advisors, I am talking about men and women President Edgar Lungu consults or talks to on policy and governance matters before making decisions or taking key actions. This could mean his State House aides, Cabinet ministers and some senior party officials – we are not including his personal friends and close family members. In this article, I have identified only five (5) key empirical examples for 2018 that demonstrate that our Head of State and Government has either weak or wrong advisors as follows: 1. Lungu was misled to institutionalise his “ubomba mwibala alila mwibala” policy When Lungu proclaimed “ubomba mwibala alila mwibala” on February 10, in Ndola, some of us noted that what the President said was official introduction of ‘kletocracy’  (rule by theft or approved theft by public servant) and constitutionally constituted an impeachable offence. We called for President Lungu to apologise and withdraw the statement. But to our rude shock, the President repeated it and ironically, Amos Chanda, Davies Mwila, Sunday Chanda, Bowman Lusambo, Antonio Mwanza and everyone around him were everywhere busy justifying the Bemba phrase with Bible verses and cultural teachings. Today, the same Bemba proverbs constitute one of the key grounds for his impeachment motion and the same people who defended him are now politically terrified and worried for their boss and jobs. 3. Lungu was misled to hurriedly expel the Cuban Ambassador Although Article 9 of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations of 1961 mandates host states at any time and for any reason to declare a particular member of the diplomatic staff to be ‘persona non grata’, the impulsive expulsion of the Cuban Ambassador to Zambia, Nelson Pages Vilas on 1st April, 2018 was hurriedly and wrongly done, announced by the wrong person at the wrong place and for wrong impulsive reasons. With good expert advisors, the whole political standoff and diplomatic apprehension between Zambia and Cuba could have been avoided as Lungu is now perceived to be a harsh authoritative leader in the region who does not entertain diplomatic engagements but only shows off his political and military might anyhow. This act watered down his democratic and diplomatic credentials regionally and globally. 4. Lungu is being misled about remaining popular by appointing and relying on MMD members In 2011, Zambians decided to vote out Rupiah Banda and his MMD team. As we speak today, Lungu has succeeded at bringing more than 40% of the MMD team back into top government positions apart from RB (although others argue that he is also in power somewhere or somehow). The worst part of this gesture is that PF is no longer running on its policy of “more money into your pocket and less tax” but on true MMD wheels of “more loans, levies and taxes” on the citizens.  While he may justify this political marriage and policy mix, this gesture annoys many true PF members as well as thousands of Zambian voters who rejected RB and his MMD government. Come 2021, this will have a huge negative bearing on Lungu’s vote. 5. Lungu is being misled that his nationality petitioners are mere lunatics or day-dreamers As Mike Mulongoti and his team are flooding the media with more data on Lungu’s inconsistent records of his nationality and other personal credentials, the best response from himself, his PF  and government advisors has been ‘ignore them as they are mere lunatics or dreamers’. But the lunatics are winning some ‘lunatic citizens’ on their side and perforating huge holes of public mistrust in the presidency. When Obama was attacked by some ‘American lunatics’ about his foreign birth and citizenship, he simply set the records straight by giving his accurate details and silenced the ‘lunatics’ once and for more. We now know that ‘lunatics’ have a tendency to win hearts and multiply themselves and thereby weakening and disadvantaging their political target. But for Lungu’s advisors, ‘lunatics’ don’t matter, he is politically safe. In conclusion, I am sure Lungu’s advisors are already assuring him beforehand about 2021 that ‘there is no way in hell the great leader of this great nation can lose power, even if he was to die a week before the elections, he will still win in the grave’.  I personally see President Lungu to be too technically vulnerable in terms of decision making as many of his policy actions seem to be a product of failed expertise, ill advice, uncoordinated public service machinery at his disposal or overzealous political appointees who are interested in making a name for themselves, bypass standard decision making protocols and end up spoiling the functional efficiency and effectiveness of the presidency.  In the same vein, it is also possible that President Lungu is either too opinionated and loosely wait for or take expert advice or he has entrusted too much policy powers into the hands of either dull, weak or wrong cadres around him. But there is no way in hell this article can make sense to them, no way.

By Chris Zumani Zimba, Political Scientist, Author, PhD Scholar, Lecturer and Consultant  ”WE, THE PEOPLE OF ZAMBIA: ACKNOWLEDGE the supremacy of God Almighty; DECLARE the Republic a Christian Nation while upholding a person’s right to freedom of conscience, belief or religion; UPHOLD the human rights and fundamental freedoms of every person; COMMIT ourselves to upholding the principles of democracy and good governance; RESOLVE to ensure that our values relating to family, morality, patriotism and justice are maintained and all functions of the State are performed in our common interest;”… The Preamble of the Constitution of Zambia (Amendment) No. 2 of 2016 clearly reads. But in Zambia today, President Lungu is consistently being accused of dangerously plundering public resources and pompously stealing from the poor in serious embezzlement fashions. When you critically analyze the facts, it is not wrong to say that ‘Eagle One’ is involved in aggravated ‘kleptocracy’ (official rule by theft) as this elected President is suspected of stealing everything and from everyone-including from more than 55% Zambians living below poverty line as well as looting public resources of 16 million citizens who are in the 10 provinces of the country. Overtly, these embezzlement allegations become more worrisome when mirrored against President Lungu’s amazing wealth acquired in nearly three years. This makes everything around ‘Eagle One’ to be at discrepancy with the aforesaid national values in our Supreme Law. On the ‘responsibilities of citizen’, Article 43. (1) (a)  of the Zambian Constitution states that “A citizen shall — be patriotic to Zambia and promote its development and good image”. Given that the corruption allegations against President Lungu betrays our economic progress and global perception, this article is a natural response and civic obedience to this national duty and expected role of a good citizen.  Theodore Roosevelt said, “We must hold to a rigid accountability those public servants who show unfaithfulness to the interests of the nation or inability to rise to the high level of the new demands upon our strength and our resources”. It is against this background that I have identified 15 reasons as to why Zambians need to take an extraordinary legal approach to allow President Lungu exculpate himself and account for all the gross corruption allegations leveled against him. This will mean trading outside Article 98 of our ‘magna charter’ by either suspending or temporally lifting his immunity in order to extract fiscal/asset audit and execute public exculpation from this elected leader based on the following grounds:  1. According to the list of declared assets in July 2016 submitted to the Electoral Commission of Zambia (ECZ) before the August Presidential and General Elections, President Lungu declared K23, 700,000 (K 23.7 Billion unrebased) as his net worth. To the contrary, President Lungu declared only K2, 500, 000 (K 2.5 Billion unrebased) as his net worth in the January 2015 Presidential bye elections when he first contested following the death of President Sata. Did President Lungu win a lotto jackpot or some sport betting game at any point between January 2015 and July 2017 which Zambians need to know? If he did how much was involved, where and when? Is President Lungu a private beneficiary of Prophet Ebert Angel or Bushili’s miracle money which swell miraculously in bank accounts by fire and thunder of faith? Even then, how much did he receive via miracle money connections and how much is non-spiritual wealth? Is ‘Eagle One’ the new Aliko Dangote or Bill Gates of Zambia? How did this Christian President acquire more than K20, 000,000 in 18 months? What is the source of President Lungu’s new abnormal riches? Unless properly explained and validated by himself, President Lungu’s wealth accumulation violates all the rules of traditional business and bank ethnics.  2. At the speed President Lungu is moving in terms of wealth accumulation, it is not premature to generalize that the 16 million poor Zambians may soon or later produce another Mubutu Seseko, a President who became richer than his poor country and people. In other words, ‘Eagle One’s wealth trajectory must bother and worry every responsible Zambian. Since he has empirically shown that he makes approximately K10, 000,000 (10 Billion unrebased) every six months, then we have an idea that Lungu will accumulate not less than K 140, 000, 000 (140 Billion unrebased) riches by 2021 or K280, 000,000 (280 Billion unrebased) net wealth by 2026 respectively. In the actual sense, these figures could be doubled as our projection is based on his self-disclosed wealth in July 2016 as stated above. This is minus the wealth of his wife-Esther Lungu, Children like Tasila Lungu or relatives from both himself and the wife. In a democracy, this must not be ignored or buried under the carpet. While it is fine for ‘Eagle One’ to become the richest Zambian soon or later, the rules of democracy and good governance also demands the President to disclose and clarify about the sources of his miracle and historical accumulation of wealth.  And this will require his immunity to be lifted or suspended given that he is also being mentioned in many corruption allegations. 3. On 10th January, 2018, the Zambian Observer controversially reported that as at the end of December, 2017, President Edgar Chagwa was among the richest people in Zambia with a net worth of around 400 million dollars which is attributed to his investment with Scania trucks and holding majority shares with undisclosed top companies in Zambia. These revelations are too scaring as it means that President Lungu has made K400, 000,000 in three years. And without ‘Eagle One’ fiscally exculpating and politically cleansing himself about his ‘magic wealth’, the President becomes a hated worst plunderer and unchurched looter of public resources in the eyes of the masses. This is because all Zambians are aware that President Lungu is not America’s Oprah Winfrey who has a monthly income of over K 69,017,664 translating into an annual salary income of K 828,211,973 or FC Barcelona’s Lionel Messi whose annual income exceed K 808,011,681 based on his monthly fortune of K 67,334,307. How and where on earth can a civil servant who is on K36, 000 monthly salary make this abnormal wealth in 3 years?  Even if President Lungu’s monthly salary plus special allowances were tripled to K100, 000, the expected income after 3 years would be not more than K3, 600,000. Under such, the question of suspending his immunity in order for him to exculpate himself cannot be ignored or wait until he leaves office in 2021 or 2026.  4. Factually, all informed Zambians know that President Lungu is not among the top 150 highest paid presidents in the world. In Africa, Lungu is only sitting on number 14 on the top 15 highest paid presidents. With Jacob Zuma of South Africa being the highest paid African President with an annual salary income K 1, 943, 063, Lungu is ranked 14th on the continent with an annual salary income of annual K 432, 000 plus special allowances of K117, 648 yearly according to ‘My Wage’s Salaries for VIPs and Celebrities’. Therefore, common sense tell us that President Lungu’s wealth between 2015 January and 2017 December was supposed to grow in the range of 25,000,000 to 400,000,000. As such, in this poor state that is battling from cholera, malaria, malnutrition and HIV infections, it is too abnormal and shocking for President Lungu to acquire such astronomical wealth to the extent that, there is need to interpret and scrutinize it with extraordinary legal tools and urgent political remedies. In this case, the question of suspending or lifting his presidential immunity cannot wait for him to leave office in 2021 or 2026.  5. On 30th December, 2017, the Zambian Observer and other Media houses reported that PF Youths impounded more than 10 trucks in Chilanga Area carrying controversial contraband, illegal Mukula timber being exported under heavy security escort from Zambia National Service (ZNS). These PF youth only demanded for answers from President Lungu as it was speculated that the transporter of the named illegal contraband was President Lungu’s personal Political Advisor, Kaizer Zulu at State House.  On 31st January, 2018, the Zambian Observer named President Lungu and his daughter-Tasila Lungu to be personally involved and responsible in the illegal export of Mukulu Timber. “Corruption will never end in PF led government because it is championed by people in authority including the head of state himself. At 21:30 hours last night, 20 trucks, carrying Mukula logs arrived at Katima Mulilo Border Post in Sesheke en-route to Namibia under heavy police escort of about 4 vehicles”, the reporter stressed. Such revelations magnify president Lungu as a pompous plunderer and dangerous thief of public resources. This erodes all the political trust bestowed upon him by the voters as Head of State and Government. Thus, ‘Eagle One’ cannot afford to be silent about his ‘scaring riches’ visas such perceived corruption linkages to his office because Zambians legally deserve to know the truth.  6. In 2017, President Lungu and his PF government controversially procured 42 fire engines at $1m (K10, 000,000) per truck, only to insure them at $25,000 (K250,000) each. The total cost poor Zambians paid through President Lungu to buy and insure these 42 fire trucks is K421, 050,000. Overtly, this is the most immoral, illogical, exploitative and expensive public procurement tender in the history of Zambia which cannot be ignored without proper answers from the president himself. By insisting that the concerned citizens were free to produce evidence if they suspected corruption in this procurement, President Lungu lacked empathy for the poor masses and failed to demonstrate good political stewardship as required from him in the Republican Constitution. Although the Anti-Corruption Commission was window dressed to hastily announce that the government followed the procurement procedure, many Zambians still believe that this immoral and abnormal procurement of 42 fire trucks had many dirty hands, gross bribes, crooked kickbacks and corrupt political beneficiaries.  It is against this background that president Lungu need to come clean and exculpate himself on this matter as many angry and bleeding hearts still link his fast growing magic wealth to such corruption scandals and embezzlement practices. 7. In 2017 again, President Lungu and his PF government authorized the procurement of 50 ambulances at $288,000 each amounting to over $11 million (K110,000,000) in total while, Toyota (Zambia), a globally renowned car manufacturer and dealer, submitted a quotation to supply the same items at about $70,000 but was allegedly turned down”. While Zambia is still a poor state and the majority citizens are living on less than 1 dollar each day amidst high levels of HIV/AIDS, malaria, cancers, cholera, hunger, malnutrition and GBV cases, it is notoriously sad and crucially unfortunate that their elected President has the luxury of purchasing the ‘most expensive goods and services’ for them as the case stand for these 50 ambulances. Was President Lungu an equal secret beneficially to this immoral looting of public resources and cruel plunder of tax payers’ money?  Surely, poor Zambians and all the citizens across the country need clear answers from President Lungu as his inaction on overt corruption like in the case of these 50 ambulance seem to have a strong bearing on his fast growing abnormal wealth.  8. President Lungu betrayed poor Zambians with moral malice and political impunity by spending K554, 000,000 (K 554 Billion unrebased) on 42 fire trucks and 50 ambulances in 2017 as already noted. These two known controversial public procurement tenders are huge moral and political transgressions against the Zambian poor and voters. Figuratively, this is what Lungu could have done with this K554, 000,000 if it was prudently spent. Based on data from State House itself for Fisenge Farm bloc Clinic in Luanshya, we now know that construction of a good rural clinic with a mortuary costs not more than K500, 000-the figure could be less if constructed by CSOs or donors. This means that President Lungu could have constructed more than 1,150 new modern clinics with inbuilt mortuaries in 2017 alone from the money spent on 42 fire trucks and 50 ambulances. We also know that building one classroom block for 120 pupils (4 semidetached classes) costs not more than K400, 000. This means that this K554, 000,000 would have built more than 1,400 blocks of classrooms in 2017 alone. Clearly, President Lungu violated the constitution, moral duty and hence betrayed the dear poor who now need to know why and how he arrived at such greedy decisions to buy ‘cheap wheelbarrows’ and ambulances when he could have improved the education, sanitation or health needed infrastructure for them. This becomes worse as his wealth seem to be becoming too abnormal every day.   9. President Lungu exposed himself on the U$ 42 million dollars spend on 42 fire trucks by firing his former Minister of National Planning, Hon. Lucky Mulusa in December 2017 for openly criticizing him and his cabinet that they bought ‘cheap wheelbarrows’ for Zambians on abnormal prices and irreconcilable amounts. “No doubt about it, Lucky Mulusa was very close to the President. He was one of President Edgar Lungu’s confidantes. However, the $42 million fire tenders appears to have rattled the feathers. I think it brought to the fore personal identity issues and the clash of principles” Green Party President, Peter Sinkamba told Lusaka Times on 26th December, 2017. Hence, the case of President Lungu and Lucky Mulusa on the 42 fire trucks (cheap wheelbarrows) is another political reason why the Zambian Head of State need to redeem his name on his own without the Jericho wall of the immunity. In the absence of this exculpation, many Zambians will always link Lungu’s magna wealth to such corruption scandals and will remain betrayed and bitter in their hearts. 10. The Zambian President must be questioned as to why he shields and cherishes corrupt Ministers, Permanent Secretaries and technocrats in his government. In itself, this is good political reason to warrant his personal exculpation now or wait for the worst. For example, President Lungu took no punitive actions against the Minister and Permanent Secretary for the Ministry of Education when they publicly apologized before the Parliamentary Accounts Committee in 2017 for spending over K2, 700,000 (K2,7 Billion unrebased) to purchase one vehicle for the minister and office furniture. Which vehicle and office furniture is worth this amount? Common sense tells you that the Minister, Permanent Secretary and technocrats involved stole tax payers’ money with malice and impunity. ‘Eagle One’ knows all the facts about this malicious looting at the Ministry of Education and just kept pretty mute about it. It is clear President Lungu does not hate corruption; he loves it and smiles in the face of open plunder of public resources and betrays the core constitutional values of political integrity, dignity, Christianity and good governance.  In this democracy, this calls for his exculpation.  11. The aforesaid under number 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,7 and 8 were all validated by Hon. Chishimba Kambwili, PF Roan MP and former Minister of Information who on December 28, 2017, told the Mast Newspaper that “What the PF have achieved in 2017 is just corruption. The President has shown no political will to fight corruption. Most leaders have become rich without have anything to show for their richness. This has been the year that most corruption has been committed in the history of Zambia and it’s under the PF and its leader Edgar Lungu”. While President Lungu’s wealth is racing to touch the sky every day and week, it is only fair and professional to stress that Hon. Kambwili’s observations pragmatically crucify ‘Eagle One’ to the extent that it must not be undermined or ignored as he implied that the Head of State and Government is stealing with malice and impunity. The President needs to redeem his political name and cleanse his republican office.  12. On 2nd January, 2018, then Minister of Foreign Affairs, PF Bahati MP, Hon. Harry Kalaba, in his resignation letter to the President Lungu revealed among other reasons that “we cannot proceed to manage national affairs with cold indifference when the levels of corruption are swelling and being perpetrated by those who are expected to be the solution”. In simple words, Hon. Kalaba was simply reconfirming that he resigned on morally grounds as his boss, President Lungu was perpetuating and was at the center of corruption. The President should surely account for these aggravated accusations of corruption in relation to his amazing fast growing wealth. In fact, in the moral or Christian court of Zambians, Hon. Kalaba and President Lungu need to be given a cross examination in order to appreciate some of the specific cases of corruption in question. Is it the 42 fire tenders, 50 ambulances, mukula timber trucks or the huge financial irregularities coming from the Auditor General’s Reports? Which corruption cases involving President Lungu compelled Hon. Kalaba to resign? Poor Zambians and tax payers need to know the truth because we are talking about their resources being plundered and looted day light. Such issues can only be digested if President Lungu’s immunity is lifted and he is personally made to answer and account for each and every corruption allegation around his neck.   13. President Lungu’s government has been the worst plunderer and looter of public resources in the history of Zambia. The 2013-2016 Reports from the Auditor General’s office validates these assertions (see our summary table on www.afrodemocracyjournal.wordpress.org under the article “How to fool and betray poor African voters: the case of Zambia’s Lungu on corruption”). For example, according to a Press Statement released on 12th January, 2018 by Ellen Chikale, Public Relations Manager at the Auditor General office of Parastatal Bodies and other Statutory Institutions for the financial year ended 31st December 2015, questionable payments were found to be at K23, 733, 573; unaccounted for stores at K20, 245, 512; Unsupported payments at K5, 557, 547 while failure to recover loans was at K4, 394, 978 respectively. All these huge irregularities and growing embezzlements are happening against the background of President’s fast growing wealth. Without proper answers from the President himself and the fact that ‘Eagle One’ does not suspend or fire any Minister or PSs on overt corruption grounds, Zambians will continue to be worried about their money in relation to Lungu’s ‘weekly growing miracle riches’.     14. President Lungu’s consistent corruption allegations make him constitutionally unfit and political disqualified to continue holding this office without proper fiscal accountability and political exculpation of his amazing wealth and gross embezzlement suspicions. Among ‘Executive functions of President’, Article 92. (1) of the Zambian Supreme Law states that “the President shall perform, with dignity, leadership and integrity, the acts that are necessary and expedient for, or reasonably incidental to, the exercise of the executive authority”. Based on the aforesaid, President Lungu has clearly lost the expected political dignity and leadership integrity in the eyes of the public and needs to redeem it after formal political cleansing and judicial exculpation.  15. We aware that our Republican Constitution has a ‘Protection of President from legal proceedings’ under Article 98. (1)  and (2) respectively which states that “A person shall not institute or continue civil proceedings against the President or a person performing executive functions, as provided in Article 109, in respect of anything done or omitted to be done by the President or that person in their private capacity during the tenure of office as President; The President shall not, in the President’s private capacity during the tenure of office as President, institute or continue civil proceedings against a person”.  But President Lungu’s corruption cases are too many and serious such that they cannot delay or wait until he leaves office. In this legally novel and politically fragile circumstance, a special tribunal of competent judges can be sanctioned by the Chief Justice following a deliberation and recommendation from the National Assembly. This is what will save and redeem Zambians for now. As an elected President, Zambians deserve proper clarity on all these issues as President Lungu is their political servant, not boss. The corruption allegations around him are too multiple while his abnormal and historical accumulation of wealth equally need convincing answers. In a democracy, a political leader must be held accountable, for Lungu the time is now as this will act as a deterrent to future presidents and cement the foundations of our democracy and good governance.  In conclusion, it is true to stress that, if a political leader steals for the poor, he/she shall receive mercy both before God and fellow man. This is because, those who steal for the poor do so for the benefits of the poor and with the best interest of the poor; they have the poor at heart. For example, in the ancient Roman Empire or medieval Zulu Kingdom, Julius Caesar and Shaka Zulu respectively both on many occasions plundered the enemy resources and stole for and on behalf of their poor masses. But many modern African political leaders are doing the opposite. They are stealing from the poor for their own personal interest and benefits. These are too evil to the extent that they shall not receive mercy both from God and fellow man as the poor only survive to see another day by God’s grace. Thus, political leaders who steal from the poor via looting of public resources in poor states commit crimes against humanity, not different from genocide or war crimes. This is why President Lungu’s immunity must be temporally suspended or lifted so that he politically cleanses himself before the Zambians from all these ‘crimes against humanity’ of corruption. If he is found clean and innocent, then Lungu’s presidential immunity will certainly be restored as the case of Rupiah Banda in 2015.,309,256,29,6,15,2,1,245,2895090013875063,/story.php?story_fbid=2895090013875063&id=129987587052000

By: Anthony Bwalya - UPND Member As the over 17 million Zambians wake up this morning, around 10.5 million of these are poised to make it through this day on just one meal; and these are the lucky ones because another close to 500,000 are not even guaranteed a single meal today.  Today alone, $2,411.27 is expected to be stolen under the PF regime; as has been the case since the PF took the mantle of power in 2011. This is how we know that an aggregate of over $10 billion has been stolen under the watch of the PF, principally by PF political actors and their  business associates. Today alone, families must find a way of bridging the K110 per day increase in the basic food basket since 2011; in an environment where real wages have been regressing at a rate of 3.2% per annum while real inflation on every basic food item has been surging by an average 14% - 16% per annum. The removal of Kaizer Zulu will not recover the close to $2 billion worth of Mukula revenue estimated to have been stolen by the #MukulaCartel since 2012, nor will it recover the close to $30 million stolen in the Firetenders scam. And in case you have not noticed, ZAFFICO IPO prospectus information have revealed that ZAFFICO managed to buy Fire Trucks for a whole $900,000 less, for around $100,000 PF government sanctioned the purchase of one Fire truck at $1 million each. As we speak, a number of cooperating partners have suspended millions of dollars per annum worth of life-saving support to areas of health, education and social protection because of grand theft and corruption by PF government officials and their subordinate actors.  Today, the PF have allowed ordinary Zambians to pay a heavy premium at the pump for fuel so that PF government officials and their friends can get paid. These are the people controlling major components of the fuel procurement and distribution cycle. The $7 billion economic SABOTAGE under the PF thanks to a loadshedding which should have been avoided cannot and will not be fixed by the removal of Mr. Kaizer Zulu. The people who have made millions of money in kickbacks in respect of the award of never ending hydroelectric power contracts are in government and are PF officials. Now, I can understand why people celebrated the removal of Kaizer from his position. Mr. Zulu had become the ultimate symbol of thuggery and impunity at the very highest level of government. But the sobering truth is that KZ was only ever the face of state capture. The real state capture has not gone anywhere. And while President Edgar Lungu may wish to portray the facade that he has turned the corner and prepared to crack the whip for the right and correct reasons, he still has Jean Kapata serving; an individual whose name has for several years now been associated with several millions of dollars unaccounted for in Mukula revenues. The President still has Stardy Mwale who received K1.6 million to build a Maternity Annex at Kabushi clinic in 2014 and do date, the facility has not been completed not has it been handed over. The President is still principal supervisor of a political party that has been receiving dirty money in kickbacks for influencing the award of public contracts.  The truth is, Kaizer Zulu has not been removed for the collective good and benefit of Zambians. Kaizer Zulu has been removed for political expediency, a move aimed at sanitizing the name of a ruling cartel gone rogue. The problems highlighted above cannot be resolved without a substantive change of government. Corruption and criminality under the PF is an institutional thing which cannot be gotten rid of by the removal of only any one single individual. So, thank you Your Excellency for pawning one of your lieutenants. Zambians will not take the bait.,217,200,5,10,2,,,96,2895070583877006,/story.php?story_fbid=2895070583877006&id=129987587052000

And Charlotte said action must be taken against anyone involved in wrong deeds – in reaction to assertions that President Edgar Lungu’s daughter, Tasila, had allegedly fenced the 3790 hectares gazetted Forest Number 70 – in Sinda, Eastern Province. Speaking with Daily Revelation, Charlotte, wife of Zambia’s former Republican vice-president Guy Scott, said the rampant destruction of the country’s trees for the apparent benefit of a few people was a tragedy. “It’s hard to imagine that this would be possible for any ordinary poacher; to export a huge number of trucks of precious hardwood, against all regulations, requires both cash and influence,” Charlotte said. “We should take the EIA report very seriously.” Asked to comment on assertions that Tasila had allegedly fenced the state Forest in Sinda, and the refusal to by Lands and Environmental Protection minister Jean Kapata and her permanent secretary Ndashe Yumba to act on the matter, despite receiving formal complaints, Charlotte said action must be taken as no one was above the law. “Action must be taken against anyone involved in wrong deeds.

High Court Judge Yvonne Chembe sentenced Mutika Mungwila to a ten-year jail term as part of her reformation. Mungwila was convicted by the Ndola Magistrate Court for trafficking in psychotropic substances and committed to the High Court for sentencing. When the matter came up for sentencing, the Prosecutor from Legal Aid Board representing Mungwila, Kateule Chitupila told the court that her client was mentally unwell which resulted in smoking marijuana, adding that she needed to be examined by a medical doctor before being sentenced. However, Judge Chembe did not entertain the application but instead dismissed it and described it as irregular, noting that the issue of Mungwila being insane did not arise during the trial at the lower court. The court stressed that Mungwila was able to prosecute her defense during trial, and the mother who was the main witness did not bring out the issue. Judge Chembe sentenced Mungwila to 10-years imprisonment with hard labour because she is a second offender. She said Mungwila was convicted and sentenced to a month jail term in January this year, but upon release from prison, she was re-convicted with the same offence. “It is sad that a girl like you cannot give up on marijuana, the law will help you reform.

The agenda of the cartel are several but the primary goal has been to protect their interest in the acquisition of money popularly known as Daily Subsistence Allowance (DSA) obtained through travels. With reduced funding to the Ministry of Education, cooperating partners such as UNICEF have been assisting the province in funding some activities such as School Level Improvement Plan popularly known as SLIP and also other funding activities such as Keeping Girls in School (KGS).

The recipient of these funds and officer in charge for distributing the funds was the Provincial Education Officer herself. The Watchdog has questioned the involvement of a civil servant with her officers from her office in involving themselves in politically aligned assignments. Civil servants are supposed to be none partisans. Confusions Brews at PEO’s Office. As a result of the money received from the President for distribution to party aligned members, it has been established that money was not well shared as some officers from PEO were not given their share despite their efforts in organizing for the event. This has created a crack in the cartel and frustrated cartel members have now opted to spill the beans of certain individual officers. It has emerged that, this cartel is so powerful and politically connected that it can displace and move anyone at will without any objection from the PEO. The cartel is controlling the PEO and she is now a fully developed cartel puppet. All decisions that she has been making have been motivated and engineered by the cartel members. An interesting case is where the PEO moves a qualified Secretary (Stenographer) and replaces her with a less qualified staff. Let Provincial Human Resource look into the qualifications of the current secretary to the PEO if at all she even has a diploma. People should not be displaced on basis of political affiliation or based on the levels of bootlicking. The watchdog has challenged the PEO to refute this truth as the dog is still in her office sniffing. The Watchdog has also sniffed in the office of the Principle Education Standards Officer (PESO) and also the Office of the Senior Planning Officer (SPO). It has come to the attention of the Watchdog that these two offices are part and parcel of senior cartel members. These are Chief Bootlicking Officers (CBOs) whose insatiable appetite for allowances is unmatched to none at the office. As the cartel cracks, information has leaked that these officers have been in the forefront of misusing donor funds especially from UNICEF on SLIP activities. They pocket money even when they don’t go out in the field to spend nights for monitoring. Reports are generated on basis of “cooked” data. Let UNICEF do a proper investigation and the truth will come out. Let senior officers at the province be probed. These are white collar thieves. The PESO brags about his connection with the PS Technical and says he is untouchable as his appointment was facilitated by PS Technical and so does SPO brag that he is PS’s beloved. The PESO has now embarked on promoting members from his church without any promotion committee seating to recommend. They are comfortable because of the support from PS Technical. Can PS Technical or PS Administration deal with these professional cadres before they mess up the province. Can the Minister disband this team to ensure that people work peacefully without threats. People are working while seated on one buttock. The Watchdog is still seated in the PEO, PESO and SPO’s offices. The resolution of the recent meeting which was held at PEO and ended about past 21:00hrs will be revealed. These are a bunch of sadists planning to professionally injure their colleagues. The drone Watchdog drone is also hovering on other SESOs like Natural Sciences and Teacher Education Unit at PEO.

Katambo married his wife, Grace Mushili, the daughter of senior chief Mushili of the Lamba-speaking people of Ndola rural in the early 1990s. The two have two children – a boy and a girl. Grace reluctantly confirmed that she was leaving her matrimonial home because the minister wanted to marry another woman. “Yes, it is true. Yes, I am packing out because he has married somebody. He told me that ‘I want to marry another woman. ‘So, if you can stay two of you….’ but me I refused to say ‘no; I can’t! Better you marry that one,’” explained Grace before cutting the line. Katambo had nothing until he married Grace, a business lady. “She made him join politics, she used her money till he won and became a minister.

And Milupi says should marijuana be legalised, government should equally legalise prostitution. Cabinet in its sitting this month approved the legalisation of marijuana, which cultivation, procession and exportation would ostensibly, be for economic and medicinal purposes. But Milupi argued that government was hoodwinking the Zambian population into believing that the sole purpose for legalising marijuana was for economic purposes because there are so many precious minerals in the country which proceeds have not benefited ordinary Zambians. He told Daily Revelation that President Edgar Lungu’s government was desperate for money to revive a potentially ‘dead’ economy. He warned President Lungu against taking desperate measures which consequences he would not handle. “This government’s desperation comes out of mismanagement and diminishing of the economy. As the opposition we have been talking about this. That’s why you see civil servants are not being paid; students are not getting their meal allowances. Because of this sense of desperation, it appears government is looking for all sorts of income and one of the last resorts they have is the growing of marijuana,” he said. Milupi questioned government’s claim that Zambia was a Christian nation, when its actions were contrary to the Biblical values. “We are trading the values, but you see what values do we have? Even though these (values) are enshrined in our constitution: is corruption our values; is discrimination on tribal lines part of our values?; Is beating people on the road because you hold high position at State House party of our values? So even when we have values, there is no mechanism to enforce those values. We have a police force that is compromised politically and so on. Now, to add on to that, we who have high moral values are the ones saying we want to start growing marijuana. To me it’s a desperate move because I look at the consequences. Are we not supposed to be a Christian country? What are we going to do with marijuana that is grown? What is going to happen to those that consume it? If you are growing marijuana at your farm, and you smoke it, are you committing an offence?” he asked. Milupi said President Lungu has failed to define the direction Zambia was going. He advised the President to thoughtfully scrutinise decisions he was making with his friends in Cabinet as such decisions have the potential to run down the country. “All sectors of the economy are not producing the way they should be producing. Th decision to grow marijuana must be carefully thought out,” he warned. He therefore cautioned President Lungu against turning Zambia into a breeding ground for drug cartels and syndicates. “ If we are not careful, in no time at all, we will be like those countries that are hunted down with huge drug cartels like they have in Afghanistan, (and) in Mexico. This is what we have opened ourselves to. No question about that! I do not really believe that we have the ability to enforce this correctly. If you look 10 years ago, there was no issue of mukula. But now, there are big people in PF dealing in mukula trade. So even this growing of marijuana, even if we define where the market is, who are the people going to be involved (in growing marijuana). And the money that will be coming from marijuana, where is it going to go?” Milupi wondered. He said currently the country was producing huge quantities of precious minerals such as emeralds which proceeds were not benefiting ordinary Zambians. Milupi said what is happening in the emerald and mukula sectors will happen in the marijuana sector where only a few government leaders and their associates benefit. “You know Zambia is one of the biggest Emerald producing countries in the world. We have been trading like US $3 million dollars (annually) but how much money is going into our budget from emerald mining? nothing!  So, it stems from our inability to have fiscal discipline; to be able to think so that we are able to benefit from the resources that are in this country. We are not benefiting from Copper, we are not benefiting from emeralds, agriculture is not producing the way it should be producing. Now are we really saying that marijuana is what is going to make us prosper?,” he asked. And Milupi further advised the government that since marijuana was in the process of legalisation, it was imperative to also consider legalising prostitution because it equally has an already flourishing market both for local and international tourists. He noted that there was no way the government can fail to open one viable sector and accept the other in the name of ‘Christian’ values when they are both immoral. “Then let us go into prostitution; because there is a market in prostitution too, if all we are looking for is money!” said Milupi. “National values are important but they must be enforced by the morality of the nation by making sure that we live according to what the constitution is saying. Because once we start growing it (marijuana), there is no end to it.”,331,244,71,10,2,2,2,264,2891580284226036,/story.php?story_fbid=2891580284226036&id=129987587052000

The point - those of us who have argued that the Sinda “Independent” Member of Parliament Masauso Tembo -is not fit to represent the people of Sinda - is not premised on his inability to speak English fluently. Rather, we are concerned of his defective reasoning which espouses Neopatrimonialism – a system of social hierarchy where patrons use state resources and power to secure the loyalty of clients in the general population. Once again, when Masauso Tembo says “If you do not support the President, because he is the one that signs money to drum a dam” what was his intention?  So what, if any single MP does not think in the same way Edgar Lungu thinks? So what if anyone does not support Edgar Lungu’s policies? While Masauso did not say what he wanted to say correctly in the eyes of English -whatever the case - his message borders on ignorance on how distribution of resources - the Constituency Development Fund (CDF) – works as per our laws. CDF must not, and is not disbursed at the compassion of President Lungu. Because ours is a democracy, MPs are free to denounce and disagree with the President and his party. The fact that distribution of CDF has been politicized to an extent that those who belong to the opposition are not given funding, does not mean representatives in the National Assembly must encourage this surge, in the manner the Sinda MP is trying to do. With this in consideration, we must therefore not fail to draw a careful understanding why Antonino Mwanza is trying to sanitize Masauso over this issue. We all know there is no master of English – but even as we agree like so, the truth is Masauso was trying to say “the UPND MPs do not deserve to be given CDF because they denounce Edgar Lungu’s policies” Understandably, Antonino Mwanza lost his character. It takes no much effort to prove this. In his article attempting to influence public opinion over cronyism of Masauso Tembo with his championing of Neopatrimonialism, the PF Deputy Media Director says:  “For those who don’t know Honorable Masauso Tembo, be informed that Honorable Masauso Tembo is a very successful business man who has done more for his people in Sinda Constituency…” This Masauso, Antonino is talking about is an Independent Member of Parliament and NOT a PF MP. He wasn’t adopted by PF in 2016, after the party opted to adopt Gladys Banda as their candidate. If this is how Antonino and his friends in PF view Masauso – as a successful business man who has helped his people in the constituency - why did they adopt Gladys Banda instead of a person whom they highly regard and knew was a people’s person? Herein lies hypocrisy of the highest order.  By the way, Antonio must not think Masauso is not known. In case he doesn’t know, many of us know what his business is and how he appears to be a successful businessman. The Sinda MP may seem to have money in the eyes of those that don’t know him. For some of us, we know that if regime changed hands today, these are people that will be reduced to what they are. Antonino Mwanza must know – just in case he didn’t know – there will never be honor for crooks. Never! As this thing goes to bed, let me state that, someone whose brain or rather thinking capacity has shifted to his stomach cannot be expected think logically – why? Because the stomach often has hunger and in this process, it affects whatever is hosts. A hungry person often loses his mind.

Zambia is a perfect sorry-site example that has seen a few organized irrational characters overpowering myriad unorganized wise people. It cannot be denied that we have a large army of wise people whose thinking can be derived both from God’s giving and through attainment of education in varsity. Those who formulated the Constitution of Zambia, to include under Article 70 Section (1) sub-section (d) which states that, anyone wishing to be a Member of Parliament must have obtained a “minimum academic qualification, a grade twelve certificate or its equivalent” did realize that, for one to be able to serve the people in a given community, one needs the basic knowledge which is attainable through completing school.  In Zambia, the minimum qualification considered herein is Grade 12 O’ Levels. The assumption was that if you can complete Grade 12, then you must be able to read and understand as well as speak.  Others have argued that attainment of a Grade 12 O’ Level is not a measure of intelligence and wisdom. However true this notion may be, the other truth is, given the complexity of parliament business and its mandate, it is disastrous to have a Member of Parliament like the Sinda Constituency representative Masautso Tembo, who can’t read and speak in Parliament. I am worried on behalf of people of Sinda and Zambia as whole. I am not worried of Tembo’s failure to speak proper English as witnessed in a video that has gone viral on social media. My worry is his outwardly inability to even understand what he was saying. When Masautso Tembo says “drum a dam” what does he mean?  When he says “If you cannot support a President because he is the one who signs money that you use to sink a dum, you can drum a dum” – what does he mean? Does Masautso Tembo even know what is involved –from Parliament’s perspective – how money is ordered for print and injected in the economy?  Does the Sinda MP even know how money is allocated to a given Constituency? You get a feeling that Masautso was trying to say ‘IT IS THE PRESIDENT WHO DETERMINES WHICH CONSTITUENCY GETS FUNDING THEREFORE, THOSE WHO DO NOT AGREE WITH HIM ON ANYTHING WILL NOT GET CONSTITUENCY DEVELOPMENT FUND (CDF)’.  In Masautso’s own thinking, if you do not support President Lungu and the PF way of thinking, then you’re excluded from benefiting from Zambia’s resource envelop.A foolish thinking cannot be far from such. Masautso is an Independent MP. He was elected to represent the interest of the people of Sinda. If, at any given point, the interest of people of Sinda contradicts with President Lungu ’s interest –then clearly, the Honorable will do what pleases the Head of State. This explains why Sinda cannot develop with Masautso Tembo as a Member of Parliament. Masautso Tembo has no moral will to do anything that espouses the interest of the people who elected him. The only thing that runs in his mind is that “it is President Lungu who signs for money to drum a dam”.  Therefore, if the people of Sinda don’t get farming inputs on time or at all, if they do not have piped water, if they do not have social needs, then their MP cannot say or demand for anything in Parliament because “the one who signs for money to drum a dam”, is the one in charge of the failures in that constituency. Herein lies a vivid illustration of how an organized fool has overshadowed disorganized wisemen. This problem is common for most constituencies in Zambia.   Mainly, the problem lies with the disorganized wise or rather the so-called educated people who have allowed organized fools to rule. Chief Chitimukulu once wrote:  _“On face value, it seems a lot of Zambians are very highly educated and in fact 80% of educated Zambians at whatever level refer to themselves as intellectuals, geniuses, philosophers etc. However, to me it appears that the greatest amount of intelligence exists in that society where people are best able to defend their rights and their liberties as against those who are desirous to undermining them. In fact, education has its main function that is the boosting up of knowledge of the people, but mere theorization and sermon devoid of practical base bears no fruit. The Central motive behind education is to fulfil the needs of a particular society. And therefore, any knowledge and especially at this critical period in Africa, which does not come down to try and break the vicious cycle in a peasant’s life, no matter how brilliant is an illusion. Education will only prove valuable when we grasp its essence and properly apply it to our daily realities. It’s not the acquisition of knowledge, but the application of knowledge that counts”_ To the so-called educated people, politics is a dirty game.

The allegations made by the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) that President of Zambia Edgar Lungu, his daughter Tasila, Given Lubinda and Jean Kapita (cabinet ministers), and Chief Kafula Musungu II, are the most serious after former President Frederick Chiluba’s corruption case. The Mukula Cartel Report insinuates that President Lungu and his daughter have been surreptitiously using established government agencies for personal ends. Such allegations dwell on gross misconduct and the misuse of executive power. If true, the president heretofore could be found culpable of graft and corruption, and his legacy scorched beyond redemption. That’s why coming clean is a matter of urgency. Engaging in discursive deflection tactics in an attempt to deter the public from accepting the report as credible is denying the people of Zambia the right to know the truth. The President using Fake News as a Deflection Tool The Mukula Cartel Report alleges that President Edgar Lungu and the afore-mentioned people are involved in a monthly illegal exportation of the Mukula (rosewood) trees in clear violation of export bans, and that the trade generates a total of approximately US$7.5 million paid annually in bribes and informal fees. Patriotic Front Media Director Sunday Chanda, a notorious spin-master, and serial spreader of misinformation, known for altering reality and twisting facts, engaged in elaborate “plausible deniability” in his effort to tamp down the impact of the report. Without providing credible counter evidence on the Mukula trade, he charged the authors of the report with treason. Other PF militants including Emmanuel Mwamba and Bowman Lusambo succumbed to the same obtrusive strategy, and helped to deflect blame by polarizing, spreading conspiracy theories, and evoking negative emotions against the report. The president of Zambia, Edgar Chagwa Lungu also bought into it. He blatantly labelled the report that has roiled the nation “FAKE NEWS” as a way of delegitimizing it (the report) and removing public concerns and establishing himself as the source of truth. By doing so, Lungu has elevated the use of disinformation as a tool of persuasion and weapon of influence to another level. Consequently, the word “fake news” has found more fertile ground in Zambia. Fake news has become a pejorative term used by corrupt political offenders to deter the public from accepting accusations that might turn out to be true. Fortunately, modern technology has made it easier to evaluate the credibility of a source. In the case of the Mukula Cartel Report, all it takes is for the President’s press aide Issac Chipampe, to engage a bit of critical thinking and conduct some research. In scholarship, there are ways to help tell the fake news from real news. I employ some here to address pertinent questions. Is the Mukula Cartel Report Fake or Credible? Checked the source: I took time to learn more about EIA, the source of the Mukula Cartel Report. I combed through Africa Confidential, scholarly journals, environmental news, books and magazines, and other credible sources. I searched for any EIA affiliations to the U.S. and UK governments and their intelligence or political wings. My independent review reveals that the nonprofit Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) has been in existence for over 25 years, campaigning on behalf of threatened wildlife species, forests and global climate (visit their website). Founded by UK environmental activists Dave Currey, Jennifer Lonsdale, and Allan Thornton, and run by Alexander von Bismarck as Executive Director, the organization conducts undercover investigations of criminal activities involving the environment, among other assignments. As stated on their website, EIA boasts of a track record that reveals the organization as arguably the most consistently independent, fearless, dynamic and effective NGO on global environmental issues. Importantly, EIA is recognized by research organizations, governmental agencies, and nonprofit organizations around the world for its “extraordinary work on the ground”. Surely, Chipampe and his team at State House can conduct an even more rigorous research what with all the investigative tools at their disposal. Is there Illegal Exportation of the Mukula in Zambia? Investigated the Report: While the timing of the Mukula Cartel Report may be suspect, I examined all the passages in the report to see if they contained any political bias that may impact the story. I found none. As a general rule, a credible story must contain reputable and trustworthy citations and references. I might add that indeed there is illegal exportation of the Mukula timber in Zambia. It has been going on for years. Chinese timber business has been in Zambia since 2005, mostly exporting material in forms of lumps and boards (see Mukula Cartel Report). Between 2001 and 2014, Zambia lost more than one million hectares of Mukula trees, (100 to 276 million trees per year), according to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild and Flora (CITES). In March 2018, the Thomson Reuters Foundation reported that Zambian authorities had begun exporting Mukula timber confiscated from illegal loggers “who continue to fell trees despite a nationwide ban to protect the country’s dwindling forests.” The custodian of the funds is Jean Kapita, the minister of Lands and Natural Resources. In the same month (March 2018), an impeachment motion was filed in the Zambian parliament against Lungu alleging, among other charges, that he was involved in the disposal of the transferring of proceeds of the sale of Mukula to ZAFFICO and not the Consolidated Fund as requested by law. It came be stated that Lungu was suspected to be meddling in the exportation of Mukula timber way before the report. Who, by Name, is Behind the Illegal Cartel? Searched for other sources: One established fact is trafficking of Mukula timber is rampant. The question is; who is really behind the cartel? This is a question only President Lungu can and must answer. Back in March 2018 when Mukula timber was confiscated, illegal loggers were arrested and/or identified. It is assumed that the Minister of Lands and Natural Resources briefed the President and/or presented him with a full report containing the names of the traffickers, the source of the Mukula, the owners of the trucks hired, and its destination. The minister’s investigation and report must be made public. It must be noted that Mukula was recently added to Zambia’s list of official commercial species and took front-page news in the reign of the incumbent Lungu. The increase of Chinese traders in the country has exacerbated the illegal exportation of Mukula timber. The Zambian Association of Timber and Forestry Based Industry alleges that about 5,000 Mukula loaded containers from Zambia have been exported to China following the ban on the exportation of the timber species. Who, by name, are the Chinese working with in Zambia? How and where do they obtain their permits? How do they pay? ZTFBI general secretary Kalowa Moota has charged that the government has breached the Forestry Act No. 4 of 2015 by affecting a ban while timber continues to be exported. Moota adds that the manner in which Mukula is exported is designed to cover illegal activities by the privileged few. It has since been revealed that the privileged few include the President and his daughter. The video interviews conducted by EIA in Zambia implicate the President and his daughter, among others. Watch the video at https://eia-global.org/reports/20191205-Mukula-cartel-zambia-report. No different from Mandrax Trafficking of the 1980s There can never be a more serious charge on a President than this. The legacy of the Zambian President has been thrust before the entire world as a symbol or proxy of corruption. Accusations of trafficking in Mukula timber are no different from those of the Mandrax drug trafficking of the 1980s. Both involve cross border illegal activities and undermine the rule of law. As President, Lungu faces legal and ethical violations. His current response to the report symbolizes totally unacceptable presidential behavior. As a legal practitioner, Lungu understands that accusations of such magnitude can carry several personal and professional devastating consequences, even if the accusations are unfounded. It can’t be emphasized enough that the Mukula Cartel Report negatively frames the president of Zambia. It erodes Lungu as the critical resource of trust, and takes the nation back into the deeper canal of corruption. Lessons from the Chiluba corruption case During the Chiluba regime, we watched a corrupt president with limitless greed, lust for power, and corrosive cynicism, mortgage mines, sell houses and deposit the money in the Zamtrop account for his personal use. Chiluba’s lieutenants assiduously protected him, and created elaborate camouflage and fiendish propaganda so successful Zambians were taken for a ride. In the end, Chiluba drove a vulnerable nation to the poorest level of the world, and left office with a poverty rate of 80%. Chiluba’s presidency demonstrates the venomous and corrosive impact of corruption on freedom and democracy. We can’t allow history to repeat itself. Time to Come Clean Enough with misinformation from royalists like Mwamba, Chanda and all those who instrumentalize fake news. They are the reason the Zambian moral engine relies on lies and cover-ups. Such serious accusations against our head of state cannot be fended off with a mere “fake news” flywhisk. Faced with such devastating accusations, President Lungu must come clean. He must not think that all he needs is a favorable opinionated spin. I strongly advise that he immediately addresses the nation factually to exculpate himself from such serious allegations. He must share with the world what he knows about the illegal trafficking of Mukula in Zambia, and provide the names of all involved if he is to clear his name. In the absence of convincing evidence, President Edgar Lungu must be held accountable. Parliament must perform its duty, and pass a vote of no confidence, and President Lungu must consider to honorably step down. Dr. Field C.

It all started in the pre colonial era. The fight which culminated in the rivalry of ANC and UNIP. The ANC was characterized and identified as  a Tonga Party. While UNIP was identified with the Bembas. Today this has continued with PF being Associated with and championing the Bemba tribe. This seen in the manner of appointments, Government Contracts, regional discrimination etc. The UPND has stood steadfast to defend its region against discrimination and right to exist as Zambians. It has been deemed a tribal approach. But then how does regions discriminated against stand up and claim what is rightly theirs if it doesn’t take a regional line? For me for HH has learned the lesson. Society is dynamic, so are it people. He has learned that taking a regional cry is not Zambians  desired dish. As it is divisive. The Zambians want a United Country. But then the Zambians also want the Country to be run by responsible leaders. That where HH comes in. He has run his life outside Politics responsibly. Take away his tribe. HH has proved to be hard working and successful responsible businessman. The qualities Zambians are looking in a leader. Zambians don’t want mismanagement of resources by a few in the name of the ruling Party. The want Economic managers who can manage the resource on behave of all Zambians. This is the test of the next Election. Has the Bemba led PF managed resources prudently on behalf of all Zambians? Have the benefits trickled down to the lowest of society. Are the leaders sacrificing for the poorest of the poor?  If yes then I see no reason of not returning PF to power.  For me it is also time for the Bembas to ask themselves if the so called leaders representing them in Government are the best reflection of its people. If not then let us try HH, but point to him that this Country does not belong to the Tongas and we don’t want Tonga domination or discrimination. We won’t accept to be divided again as a Nation. We want Economic Managers to run the business of this Country. Not corrupt jokers.  Politically I feel HH has been an average Politician. Like all Politicians building an image of the ‘Only One.’ Done away with strong competitors to remain the only one. This does not work with Government. Don’t surround yourself with stooges who say yes even to your rubbish. Surround yourself with people who will give you the best critic to make you a better leader. Mazoka had such qualities.

He said the wanton cultivation of marijuana will have drastic negative potential consequences to the social fabric of Zambia. He said allowing the cultivation of cannabis increased its availability and acceptability which creates a public health concern. He said although the Dangerous Drugs Act of 1967, gives the Minister of Health discretion to give or reject licence to cultivate  cannabis for medicinal purposes, he said government had no capacity to supervise such a stringent process. Chitalu said the body of knowledge on cannabis medicinal value was growing and when sufficient information is scientifically  gathered, Zambia might in future, consider the cultivation, trade and exportation of cannabis.

Good people, just make some time to read the Dangerous Drugs Act of 1967 and ask yourself the question I am asking.

UPND is a malicious socio-political misfit that has been rejected multiple times by the Zambian people; so out of desperation, they now want to fan civil unrest. They have become so desperate that they not only pose a danger to the current general peace and stability of our beloved Zambia: but to Zambia's future as well- our children. But why did UPND choose to place innocent young lives in harm's way? It clear: because they wanted at least one of the children to die in order to make political capital out of it. They are ready to sacrifice human life. That's why people call them satanic. The Chaisa farce is part of a  scam by the UPND leadership to front other people's children from "ku komboni" in their reckless politics.  The UPND life President is eagerly hoping to spark riots across the country to further his personal political interests, even if it means sacrificing the lives of innocent children in the process.  We urge the Police to investigate this matter even as we thank them for their professional handling of the matter under extreme provocation by politicians who are red with their blood thirstyness.  This is rain season and everyone knows loadshedding will significantly reduce. Clearly as the rains pour, and the water bodies fill up, loadshedding will drop; yet someone wants to capitalise on it before it ends. Their desperation is mindless. Its an outrage! How can someone be so desperate to engineer protest by children to march against loadshedding? Shame what a spineless cowardly low life fellow!

The Kwacha, which for a long time exchanged at 2 to 1 Rand, recently touched par with the South African currency, a psychological barrier few thought could be crossed. This is not good news for the cost of imported goods that fill South African supermarket chains in our capital, Lusaka. The US dollar for its part, at the time of writing this article, was trading upwards of K15 as compared to 5 to 1 in 2011 when the ruling Patriotic Front (PF) first came to power. To be sure, it seems like so long ago when citizens’ biggest problem was a corrupt, but arguably functional Movement for Multi-party Democracy (MMD) government, under which the economy boomed and Zambians, though resentful at the arrogance and graft, had a bounce in their steps. Well, at least for middle-class Zambians that was the case, but that is a whole separate story. So angry were Zambians with former President Rupiah Banda – and especially with his sons who were accused of getting brazenly rich on public contracts – that they ultimately voted in the PF, which was led by ardent populist Michael Sata. He promised Zambians “people-centered governance” and sold the Zambian poor a few pies in the sky. Of course, Mr. Sata soon reneged on his promises, such as reining in Chinese influence in the country. He also filled his cabinet and diplomatic posts with kith and kin – and this, in a stunningly unapologetic manner. He then died while in office. And that is when the real trouble started.  Shortly thereafter, Zambians gave a sympathy vote to another PF candidate, former Minister of Defense Edgar Lungu, who even just a cursory interrogation would have shown to be, shall we say, less than suitable for the presidency. The result of that choice is why Zambia finds itself in a predicament today. There is a power crisis that no one could have imagined a few short years ago when electricity was largely taken for granted by urbanites connected to the grid.  Power cuts of upwards of sixteen hours a day are now the norm.  As for money, the fiscus is more hole than numbers with President Lungu recently forced to admit that only 10% of the budget is available to run the country. The rest of the money is going to government emoluments and to service a debt stubbornly contracted by a government which, by turns, ignored or insulted the cacophony of voices who rightly raised alarm at the country’s debt appetite.  In turn, no money means no medicine in hospitals. Salaries are routinely delayed. Add critical survival benefits have been withdrawn from students who have always depended on government support to access the education that is the only equalizer in an increasingly unequal country. Overall, today, Zambia is rated as the fifth hungriest country in the world. In the midst of all this, government corruption and the mismanagement of state resources have flourished. Before the public can pick their collective jaws off of the floor about one scandal, another one breaks. One may ask: How is the government of the Republic of Zambia responding to all of this? The simple answer is that it is at sea. President Lungu is generally reticent, and almost never heard from. (Well, to be fair, Lungu did grace the country to a rare press briefing recently, after enough memes about his absenteeism had made the rounds on social media and elsewhere).  The Zambian police are one of very few sectors where the budget allocation has grown in the last couple of years. The government is quickly buying face masks and anti-riot gear, batons, and new armored vehicles in the name of “law and order.” It feels like the government is arming itself against the people. The newly well-equipped anti-riot police, unlike the president, are seen and heard from often. They do not like citizens to gather or to stand up and be heard.  So, today, Zambians are left wondering what happened to their country that not too long ago was touted as an “emerging democracy” — a Zambia that just recently was a declared middle income country and a winner of the African Nations Cup – buoyant on hope and promise.

A Lusaka-based relative of one of the deceased reportedly visited the morgue and identified one of the men, according to group spokesperson Oom Kamati.  Although the families said they have identified the deceased, The Namibian newspaper cannot reveal their identities as the Zambian and Namibian authorities have not yet officially released their names, or confirmed them as Namibians. Namibia Police spokesperson Kauna Shikwambi said although the Namibian Police heard the news, they were still waiting on the Zambian authorities to confirm whether the deceased are indeed Namibians.  Currently, the details of the incident are unclear and incomplete.  Last week, the Zambian online news outlet Zambia Reports stated that the police in Lusaka had gunned down seven suspected criminals thought to be foreign nationals, who are believed to have been aided by some Zambians. The seven men were killed on 6 December, after the police allegedly received a tip-off from members of the public that they were about to stage a robbery. It is unclear what kind of robbery they were going to stage. Zambian police spokeswoman Esther Katongo was quoted as saying: “The criminals are suspected to be foreign nationals.” Their bodies are reportedly in a mortuary at the University Teaching Hospital, awaiting identification and post-mortems. Since the news of the shooting broke, several Namibians took to the Zambia Reports' Facebook page, requesting for images of the deceased.  Kamati told The Namibian yesterday that the Namibian High Commission in Zambia had expressed willingness to assist with the repatriation process, but the families have to do the paperwork. “We haven't received clear instructions from the high commission regarding the information we need to provide. The people who went to Zambia only went because the high commission is slow in their response. “The people [family] are on their way to Zambia because there is a rumour circulating that only the identified bodies will be repatriated, and the rest will be cremated,” said Kamati. “We don't know how the law works in that country because they only released the names of five people. We don't know what will happen to the other two bodies,” he added. The families further expressed disappointment that the Zambian authorities could not provide the names of all the deceased. “They [Zambians authorities] are telling us that they found passports on the people, but they are not saying from which countries they come. We don't know what they are hiding,” he said. Kamati confirmed that they have so far received five names of the deceased persons, and are still waiting for the names of the other two men. The families have obtained quotations from car hire companies as well as airlines in preparation for the repatriation of their loved ones. The second group of Namibians are expected to travel to Zambia soon. The Zambian media has reported that the police who carried out the operation recovered four firearms, among them three pistols and one revolver with rounds of ammunition. They also recovered a silver motor-vehicle, a Toyota Ipsum, which the alleged criminals were using, two registration number plates AAJ 4317 and ABM 9712, two masks, 22 assorted cellphones and assorted foreign currency, among them Chinese, Indian, Zimbabwean, Malawian and Singaporean currencies.,182,149,,,5,26,2,54,2886279601422771,/story.php?story_fbid=2886279601422771&id=129987587052000

By: Anthony Bwalya - UPND Member While the global copper market is worth just above $260 billion, with Zambia claiming just slightly above 4% of the global market, with net revenues of only around $500 - $700 million per annum ( I stand to be corrected). The global cannabis market, on the other hand, is currently estimated to be worth $340 billion and just keeps on growing.  It must be noted that the level of technical expertise and intensity of capital associated with the cannabis supply chain, from growing, marketing to selling; is relatively friendly and nowhere near as laborious as the mining industry, perhaps save for a few stringent global regulatory requirements. But what this means is that Zambia and Zambians can own the Cannabis industry 100% and internalize 100% of all forex revenues arising from this business. Capturing even a paltry 1% of the global Cannabis market could potentially generate a staggering $3.4 billion per annum for the country. But again if we are not careful, this amount of money could very easily end up in the hands and pockets of cartels who I imagine are well poised to pounce on this multi billion honeypot. Our biggest problem at the moment is the $250,000 lisence fee requirement. This is in effect an invitation to big money foreign and local cartels to not only use Zambia as a platform to clean up their dirty money, but also an opportunity for them to make an easy killing at the expense of Zambians. If this happens, we would have laid the perfect breeding ground for an underground Cannabis market which will undoubtedly be punctuated by gun violence as participants look to claim a share of what they believe is an opportunity systematically denied them. The sensible way to go about this program is to initially place the cultivation, marketing and selling of Cannabis in the hands of a disciplined state institution such as the Zambia National Service (ZNS). Let these be assisted and equipped with all the initially required expertise  and tools and let them get the show started. In the process, they will create employment for hundreds of youths and other professionals. But ZNS will also be crucial to provide the right kind of discipline in so far as preventing the wanton theft and abuse of the product from their production areas. In the meantime, the government should look to building and strengthening a functional framework that ensures that the growing, marketing and export of Cannabis is done in an orderly and beneficial manner to the country and it's people; as well as paving the way for the gradual participation of small scale farmers and other private sector players into the industry. As far as the participation of small scale farmers and local private sector is concerned, the lisence fee must be enabling enough to ensure that locals are not excluded from actively and fully participating in building their own economy. The participation of foreign entrants must be heavily regulated and restricted to working partnerships with locals to avoid the unnecessary externalization of forex revenue. At the end of the day, this must be an enterprise fully owned by Zambians. Politicians must resist the temptation of hijacking this enterprise away from the people. We have already seen this with Mukula and other mineral resources where corrupt government officials have been the principal beneficiaries while the people suffer. We cannot and we will not accept this sort of scenario with Cannabis. The legalization of Marijuana in Zambia could well be the making or breaking of us. Good luck my people.,228,208,3,17,,,,58,2886228248094573,/story.php?story_fbid=2886228248094573&id=129987587052000
ObjectId("5e0ca44f4c36d57ff9611c6e"),Zambian Watchdog,,2019-12-16 23:35:36,Editor,  The issue of cannabis legalisation has come at a time when the country has witnessed degazzeting of forest reserves and allocation of the same land to people in power. Would it be wrong for someone to conclude that this legalisation of cannabis is a well planned move? The barrier to entry set at USD250,000 annual license fee also speaks to this fact. The involvement of ZNS in the cultivation process is a clear signal that only those connected to the powers will have access to ZNS. They have been reports that the alleged unaccounted Mukula trucks  were been escorted by the ZNS. How credible is this ZNS that has now been used to facilitate seemingly illegality?  What makes ZNS fool proof when it comes to export of cannabis compared to the role they have played in the export of mukula, whose proceeds were never remitted to the Treasury? The whole thing doesn't look transparent. How can Government only issue a statement after the matter has gone viral on social media? Why were the public and people of Zambia being kept in the dark if that cabinet decision was meant to benefit all categories of farmers as a way to diversify from maize growing? The secrecy clearly tells you that this decision did not have the farmer at heart. If I was in government, It would have even been better to have started with something like  "government has decided to legalize the growing of cannabis but starting with a pilot project under ZNS whilst policies and regulatory framework and proper institutional capacity is being worked out and developed. In the short to medium term, government will allow all small scale farmers to participate in the cultivation and processing of cannabis under a transparent legal framework which allows use for medicinal purposes, recreational purposes and industrial use etc! The move is aimed at actualisation of the agricultural policy on diversification and to ensure the the farmers do not get stuck with their cannabis products upon harvest but should have a ready market, locally or externally ". Cannabis as a psychotropic substance needs well coordinated systems and controls to avoid the trade opening up the country to drug dealers who may end up turning Zambia into terrorist financing territory arising from drug trade. Government is also expected to issue or to spell out what actions they will immediately undertake as regards to those international treaties that were signed forbidding the growing and trade in such substances. Secondly, changes to existing laws will need to be passed through Acts of Parliament to legitimize the proposed legalisation.  The silence and hidden nature raises more concern as to the true spirit behind this closed door legalisation.,138,128,,2,1,7,,55,2885257918191606,/story.php?story_fbid=2885257918191606&id=129987587052000

Jeff Mbewe You choose to “Legalise” the cultivating and exporting of Marijuana and put $250,000 as a requirement for anyone wishing to deal in this commodity- are these wolves in government really serious? For a country whose more than 60% of the populace live in abject poverty, it is very interesting to know in whose interest this so-called legalization has been sanctioned for. Obviously, this is legalizing drug dealing only for the benefit of very politically connected crooks in Zambia. It is not even a cheap affair for the mere PF cadres whose preoccupation is forming WhatsApp groups, producing and circulating voice notes as an occupation they use to get petty handouts. This is high level drug dealing for the ‘who is who’ in the PF administration.  Other than the high level corrupt politicians, it is the so- called investors who will afford this “business”. But as seen from copper and other natural resources such Mukula, Marijuana is not going to benefit Zambians per say despite being grown here. This is exactly what they have done with Construction contracts. All major contracts have been given to foreigners who come here with their equipment, make roads and carry the dollars to their homes leaving us with substandard roads which crack in months of being in existence! It takes very little intelligence – if a little is all that one needs – to know that when you have huge sums of dollars externalized from a poor country as ours, your own currency will be on knees as can be seen from how the Kwacha keeps on sinking. Can these greedy wolves in government today tell us, which Zambians will afford to pay $250,000? What sort of business do such people do, for them to afford paying that amount? This is exactly what they have done with exporting of mealie meal and Mukula. It’s the top cream of crooks in the PF government who are the sole beneficiaries. Ordinary people that dare export three or four bags of Unga to Congo will be caged, treated as less human and thrown into prison mercilessly. We have reached a point where, it matters less who we vote for in 2021 but we need to change. We need to change because the crop of character we have are unashamed of stealing from poor people. Their stealing is difficult to ignore.  At any particular point, some policy is introduced to facilitate business that is only reserved to them, their kids, relatives, girlfriends and boyfriends and corrupt associates. What Zambian people need to realize – from old to young regardless of tribe and political affiliation - is that what has befallen Zambia is not a matter of God to step down to Zambia or to send his son Jesus Christ again to sort out our problems. God is not in the habit of coming down on earth to solve people’s problems. These problems we face every day are man created and can only be sorted out by ourselves. Luckily, we do not need guns to solve them. All we need to be resolved and decide to register and vote against these crooks. Once we become complainants on social media but in actual sense boycott voting, we give these thieves room to manipulate the less privileged and uninformed masses into voting for them again.,243,213,3,13,1,11,2,97,2884785601572171,/story.php?story_fbid=2884785601572171&id=129987587052000

He further questions the doctrine of a Christian nation exporting marijuana and the potential spillover effects on the Zambian society. We think that the aspect of legalising marijuana will undoubtedly spike criminality levels and add a new dimension of addiction to the substance abuse among the youths. We think that the debate on the legalisation of Marijuana has not been exhaustive.  This is a critical issue involving society and cannot be willynilly be decided by a few elements intending on legally exporting the substance without considering the ramifications and the ultimate spillover effect in the environment and subsequently in the region. Arguably, legalising marijuana will undoubtedly attract global criminals who will setup camps here and escalate violent drug crimes. We think that this delinquent government needs a rethink on the legalisation of the substance rather than just the profiteering motive. They’re indeed grave consequences to such hurried and premature crafting of such legislation. No bonafide self-respecting Christian nation can allow for the cultivation and export of Marijuana because it destroys and ruins lives.It is absolutely leaving a lie. We think that this piece of legislation is a prelude to a violent society defined by lawlessness and addiction to substance abuse. Gayism and legalisation of Marijuana go hand-in-hand and are both offshoot of moral decay in any given society. Marijuana will ultimately render the majority of young people into cabbages and spike the numbers of those requiring mental health treatment. In my submission Marijuana does more criminal damage to society than it benefits it. It is not too late to withdraw this ill timed legislation.  We think that the disadvantages of legalising marijuana by far outweighs any realistic long term benefits as ultimately consumption of the substance becomes normal and widespread. We think that we are not equipped to handle the resultant violence  arising from the consumption of the substance. We think that it is the desperation to make money that has driven this morally bankrupt and corrupt government to resort to selling the long outlawed substance. In totality we condemn the legalisation of Marijuana in Zambia regardless of any short term benefits to the Country.

By: Anthony Bwalya - UPND Member Let us be very clear from the onset, and state that it is the primary preoccupation of President Hakainde Hichilema and indeed the United Party for National Development (UPND), that we should create a society that works for everyone; and one that provides real opportunity for the youth to explore their talents and optimise their potential to succeed. Let it also be know, that in an era where politicians find it fashionable to parade the weak and helples for political expediency, Mr. Hakainde Hichilema has never sought or attempted to use his position of privilege to exploit the vulnerability of those least fortunate for his  political ends. Mr. Hichilema continues to provide invaluable assistance to a lot of hard-pressed citizens and yet he has never sought to exploitatively benefit from the fragility of the people to whom he continues to provide assistance. For him, helping people is not a political issue. It is Ubuntu.  And indeed, the much publicized case of Tina Kaluza, a supposedly talented young woman who wants to engage and explore the world of entertainment in Nigeria, is a very curious one. It appears that this is a young woman whose vulnerability was set up for exploitation by unconscionable, unrepentant, opportunistic politicians; who wanted to capitalize on the almost unsuspecting naivety of an honest young person, for their own floundering political ambitions.  The case of Ms. Kaluza is the perfect example of how the Patriotic Front (PF) have relentlessly persued an agenda of destructive economics, an agenda that has exacerbated poverty; as well as diverting opportunity and choice away from ordinary people and firmly placed the fate of the masses at the mercy of corrupt government politicians belonging to the PF. The PF must be reminded, that since they took power in the summer of 2011, a staggering $2,411.26 has been stolen every minute; suggesting an unfathomable + $10 billion taken away from Zambians by corrupt politicians and their associates.  The Patriotic Front party itself, continue to illegally solicit for financing through the irregular award of public contracts; with over over $10 million thought to have been obtained  by pawning our collective public interest for partisan benefit. The 2018 Financial Intelligence Center report revealed K10 million was illegally paid to the Patriotic Front after gambling with public contracts. And it is this level of greed under the stewardship of the PF that has created the kind of destitution that Ms. Kaluza has found herself in, the sort of hopelessness that systematically denies, even the most talented of young men and women, an honest opportunity to pursue their dreams.  The PF and it's leadership enjoy this kind of brokenness. It is this kind of systematic exclusion that gives them the perfect opportunity to prey on the susceptibility of innocent, often hardworking citizens, by parading them to the masses for their perverted political gain. This is why even President Edgar Lungu has no shame having his name imprinted on relief supplies to people whose suffering has ironically been occasioned by the lack of sound leadership of the PF. This is also why Mr. Lungu's foremost disciple and bonafide bootlicker Mr. Bowman Lusambo, unashamedly goes into a constituency and distributes over K1 million worth of mealie meal and contemptuously throws money in the air for people to scramble over. Lusambo comes to Kabushi and parades our grandmothers and fathers for the cameras, not as symbols of timeless wisdom and wise counsel, but as apparatus of political opportunity for himself, President Edgar Lungu and the Patriotic Front. This is the character and legacy of the PF - political opportunists and vultures, waiting to prey on the vulnerability of the next victim. Ms. Kaluza provided them with that opportunity and they took it.  Mr. Hichilema will not participate in the open exploitation of a young woman, or indeed any other citizen who may require assistance, for political purposes. We will focus on creating society - wide systems that will be aimed at creating lasting platforms of opportunity for all,  primarily here at home.,364,337,5,17,3,2,,58,2883805511670180,/story.php?story_fbid=2883805511670180&id=129987587052000

To us whose political affiliation remains unknown, you can't help us.  This is hypocrisy of the highest standard. You are not givers but you only give to gain political mileage and tarnish the name of opposition leaders.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION ABOUT HAPPENINGS AT HORIZON SCHOOLS Dear parents and guardians, The Government of the Republic of Zambia was impressed by the quality of education being offered by Horizon Schools in South Africa while H.E. Ambassador Leslie Mbula was Zambia’s High Commissioner in that country. Prior to opening of Horizon Schools in Zambia, the Government of the Republic of Zambia sent an entourage of technocrats to South Africa on a fact-finding mission about the quality of education being offered by these schools in that country.  The mission to South Africa was successful and consequently, Horizon Schools in South Africa was invited by the Government of the Republic of Zambia to open similar schools here in Zambia. In 2009, a Memorandum of Understanding and Contract Agreement were signed between Horizon Educational Trust (HET) and the Government of the Republic of Zambia (GRZ) through the Ministry of General Education (MoGE). In these agreements, the Government of the Republic of Zambia offered land on which Horizon Schools were to be built in order to provide quality and affordable education to the Zambian populace. In the same year (2009), there was a ground breaking ceremony on the land where Horizon Schools are currently built was officiated by government officials. Horizon Schools commenced operations in 2011 and was officially opened by the fourth Republican President of Zambia, His Excellency Mr. Rupiah Bwezani Banda on 23rd March, 2011.  Since inception in 2011, Horizon Schools have continued to offer excellent but affordable education as could be seen from the 100 percent pass rates at Grades 7, 9 and 12 levels.  The Schools have also promoted the teaching and learning of Mathematics, Science and ICT through such competitions as Horizon Mathematics Competition, Horizon Computer Olympiad at provincial level and participation in regional and international science fairs and Olympiads where our pupils won different types of medals, such as the Info matrix in Tanzania (Silver medals), the International Environmental Project Olympiad in Azerbaijan (silver medals), the young inventor’s Project in Georgia (gold medals), the Genius Olympiad in America (Silver medals) and the 2019 16th International Junior Science Olympiad in Qatar (Bronze medal). As part of Social Corporate Responsibility, Horizon schools has continued to offer academic and talent scholarships to learners who are economically disadvantaged but intelligent to learn in Horizon Schools and in some cases proceed to tertiary or university level.  Horizon Schools have also sunk bore holes and renovated a number of schools within Zambia in line with the provisions of a Memorandum of Understanding recently signed with the Ministry of General Education. The Schools have got a policy to support girl-child education. In line with this, we are working with a number of institutions such as the Esther Lungu Foundation Trust. The operations of Horizon Schools have been in accordance with the provisions of the MoU and Contract Agreement until recently on 24th September, 2019 when we received a letter from the Ministry of Lands and Natural Resources and Gazette Notice regarding Compulsory Acquisition of Horizon Schools.  There was yet again another letter dated 29th November, 2019 from Ministry of lands and Natural Resources and another Gazette Notice regarding Compulsory Acquisition of Horizon Schools: Notice to Yield Up. This development has shocked Horizon Educational Trust and the school management as a whole since there were assurances from the MoU, Contract Agreement and the government of the Republic of Zambia. Due to these assurances, a lot of investments have been made.  Horizon Schools have not in any way breached any of the provisions in the agreements and therefore the letters and the Gazette notices that have been served to Horizon Schools do not have any justification whatsoever. We do hereby most sincerely assure you our dear parents and guardians that all Horizon Schools operations for 2020 will continue running smoothly because we have not received any negativity from the Ministry of General Education who recently came to inspect and approved the school for 2020 renewal of registration.  This matter has since been communicated to the relevant stakeholders including the lawyer who is closely following up the issue with High Court of Zambia to secure the investments as contained in the provisions of the agreements mentioned above. Thank you and be blessed!,141,125,7,4,3,1,1,36,2882450595139005,/story.php?story_fbid=2882450595139005&id=129987587052000

Half of the students are on sponsorship ranging from 10 to 100 per cent. The school has a record of 100% pass rates at Grades 7, 9 and 12 levels and focuses on STEM subjects. Horizon was built on the Ministry of Education (Kabulonga Secondary Schools) land, an act sanctioned by the MMD regime of Prez Rupiah Banda. It was launched in Zambia in 2009 through an MoU with GRZ which offered this land to Horizon. The school officially started operating in 2011 and was officially opened on March 23, 2011, by then Prez RB. All was well until 18 July 2018 when Turkish Ambassador to Zambia, Sebnem Incesu, accused HORIZON (without naming it) as being led by “terrorists.” Apparently, the school is connected to the world-wide Fethullah Gülen organisation which is in more than 160 countries, including Zambia, according to Incesu. The Gulen movement was founded by the-now USA-based Moslem cleric, Gulen, who was accused of inspiring the attempted coup in Turkey on 15 July 2016 leaving 251 people dead in Ankara. Thousands of arrests followed throughout Turkey. Gulen was once a close ally of the tough-talking Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. At her 2018 press conference, Incesu said: “Two years have passed since the failed coup attempt. There has been a thorough investigation and this subject matter is something very important for Turkey...this organisation, which [was] behind the coup attempt is actually active all over the world, [and] that includes Zambia. Fethullah Gülen, you know this name...is the leader of Fethullah Gülen terrorist organisation; this is also an international crime organisation... We consider this organisation not only a threat to Turkey, but also all the countries they are active.” Further, Incesu said: “Actually, they have a primary and secondary school, they have a nursery school and a businessman association. How do we know that these people are related with the Fethullah Gülen organisation? There are lots of intelligence reports, testimonies, so we know that certain people in those schools; I’M NOT TALKING ABOUT STUDENTS, BUT THE ADMINISTRATION OF THOSE SCHOOLS, HEADMASTERS. So, those people administering those structures, we have strong evidence that they have affiliation of the Fethullah Gülen organisation. And let me add this; they don’t have any connection with the Turkish Embassy. We don’t recognise those people. They have no relation at all with the Turkish Embassy.” She said Turkey was in touch with the Zambian Gvt though the Ministry of Home Affairs and she hoped that these contacts would “yield positive results soon.”  The Turkish embassy statement came a day or so before Erdogan flew into Lusaka for a one-day [few hours] official visit. He was on his way back home after attending a BRICS Summit in RSA.  Erdogan was at the BRICS meeting as Chair of Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC). Earlier in June 2018, Prez ECL attended the inauguration of Erdogan as a more powerful executive president after abolishing the office of Prime Minister in his Govt. Also, Turkey has strong military relations with Somalia and Sudan. In May this year, Defence Minister Davis Chama visited Turkey under the Defence Cooperation Agreement between the two countries. In an interview with Turkey’s International News Agency, Anadolu, Chama announced that Zambia’s Attorney General had cleared the draft Defence Cooperation Agreement and Memorandum of Understanding on Cooperation with Turkey in the field of Defence Industries. Anadolu quoted Chama as saying that “We need to see how we can develop our defence industries together with Turkey and enhance defence cooperation as we secure the world and the African continent.” On 24 September 2019 Govt sent a letter to Horizon, together with a Gazette Notice notifying Horizon that it has been ‘nationalised’ and also informing the school of the “Compulsory Acquisition of Horizon Schools.” A month later, on 29 November 2019, the Ministry of Lands and Natural Resources issued a Govt Gazette notice “regarding the Compulsory Acquisition of Horizon School: Notice to Yield UP.”   This 1960s UNIP-style takeover of a private school, run by a Zambian-registered independent Trust dominated by Zambians, is being challenged in the High Court of Zambia.  It is estimated that the Trust invested more than $4million in the school infrastructure alone Horizon is opposite Chibelo [Govt] Primary School and Hilltop Hospital in Kabulonga.,244,183,2,2,16,36,5,94,2882029988514399,/story.php?story_fbid=2882029988514399&id=129987587052000

This is not correct.  As citizens would expect,  the UPND and Mr. Hichilema receives and handles lots of requests from different people with special needs almost on daily basis. During Mr. Hichilema's radio Phoenix appearance, there were lots of people that came to offer him solidarity. Some came with various requests and were referred to relevant party offices as in the case of the the artist who was referred to the UPND Chairperson for Information and Publicity who is myself. The lady  told me that she had an air ticket to attend a function in Nigeria but had missed her flight.  According to her,  she wanted some money to change her flight to another time as demanded by Air Rwanda.  She said she needed K600 to change the flight. I decided  to deal with the matter myself as I thought  that this was not a big matter  that needed to be handled by the President.   It  was actually myself who assisted her with K600.  I thought her problem was sorted out. She however came back to tell me that she now required an additional K5000 to change the same air ticket. I told her that it appeared unreasonable that an airline would demand K5,600 just to change a flight. In my experience as a traveller,  I have also missed flights but has never been charged such a huge amount of money  which is as good as buying a new air ticket.   I told her to bring the documents to the office.  I  wanted  to verify the genuineness and authenticity of her programme in Nigeria. The party takes particular screen processes in the case of requests for citizens that want to travel abroad because of the numerous internet scams where people have ended up stranded. President Hakainde Hichilema did not directly deal with her. I'm disappointed that the lady is now trying to discredit President Hakainde Hichilema over the matter.

And the Watchdog has discovered that Omnia double-dosed Zed Farmers’s crops by putting double the dose of nitrogen. The double dose caused a terrible out break of bacterial spec a tomato disease on Tuzini farms. But when Zaloumis went to complain to Omnia, Omnia boss Mark Tindle called her ‘a useless kaffar’ who will never succeed in agriculture.  Due to the double dosing by Omnia, Zed farmer lost seven hectares of crops.  Alarmed by the disease in the tomatoes, Zed Farmer sent leaves for testing to a lab in South Africa. The lab requested the fertilizer programme after which they confirmed that the plants contained excessive nitrogen.  When Zed farmer engaged Omnia, they sent two agronomists to the farm and confirmed their mistake but refused to put it in writing.  According to sources within Omnia, Omnia had initially wanted to grab the title deeds for Tuzini as guarantee for the fertilizers they were collecting on credit, but Zaloumis refused.  According to Sources in Omnia, The agronomist who double dosed the crops is Cuan Smith.  According to other sources in the agriculture industry, Omnia deliberately targets successful Zambian farmers to make them fail by overdosing their crops.  ‘Their strategy is to sell more fertilizers to make money, so double dose the fields,’ said one person. After her crops were deliberately overdosed by Omnia, Zaloumis followed the advice of the lab in South Africa and put the crops on half the dosage recommended by Omnia and the crops started doing fine with the same Omnia fertiliser but after half the dose.  Omnia fertiliser has sued Zaloumis for allegedly failing to pay $11, 000 worthy of fertiliser. According to insiders, Zaloumis has not failed to pay but has refused to pay exorbitant interest and is not happy that Omnia deliberately overdosed her crops.,869,701,8,22,16,114,8,316,2881451278572270,/story.php?story_fbid=2881451278572270&id=129987587052000

Reacting to PF media director Sunday Chanda’s assertions to Daily Revelation that the ruling party would receive Kapalasa and Ilambo Ward councillor Kelvin Mwamba as they were PF members at heart, Kapalasa said it would be madness of him to jump ship when everybody knew that the PF was not going anywhere. He wondered how the PF would welcome him back when he had never been a member of the ruling party, saying his “brother” Chanda was misinformed. Kapalasa likened the behaviour from the PF to one that had reached a dead end, and was now desperate to find any nearby object they could cling on to survive drowning. He said the closest association he had with the ruling party was to repair the toilets at the secretariat, which he said were stinking the last time he visited the PF headquarters. “I found the toilets stinking at the PF secretariat. The sewer system was overflowing and with the help of my friends we repaired the toilets. When someone cleans your toilet does it mean they have become your member?” wondered Kapalasa, adding that he believed in the vision of the UPND and had found a home in that party. Chanda claimed in an interview with Daily Revelation that the UPND was not confident about their two members Kapalasa and Mwamba remaining within their ranks. “They (UPND) are not confident about that seat, just the same way they are not confident about Katuba. They feel Bampi can switch any time. They have never been comfortable, they know he was PF until they settled on him. They don’t trust their MP in Katuba because they know he was a committed member and worked with PF, including that councillor in Ilambo,” Chanda said.,333,294,29,5,3,2,,62,2881359461914785,/story.php?story_fbid=2881359461914785&id=129987587052000

Fellow Zambians, especially those who have been born and grown up in Lusaka know the old natural beauty of the Woodlands Chikoleka Forest. IT IS FINISHED or about to. First it was some not so mysterious flats opposite Regiment Catholic Church. Then another demarcation to facilitate the building of the National House of Prayers - Hallelujah. This week, including just now, there's massive clearing of another massive portion of the forest land, just opposite the Arackan barracks Eastern foot gate. See photos attached. The Republican president Mr Edgar Chagwa Lungu will be very annoyed with the Minister of Lands and Water Development Minister for not heeding to his directives as regards to the effects of climate change. During the 4th Session of the 12th National Assembly as well as during the official opening of Parliament this year, the president directed that NO houses, any structures or factories are to built near or in any water resources points. Basically saying No destruction to trees anywhere, in view of climate change. The Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Lands and Natural Resources Ndashe Yumba will be very annoyed with his Speech Writers and his Directors for making him give a very moving and passionate speech at the ongoing Madrid Climate change Conference COP-25 in Madrid, Spain. The PS reported to the Honorable and Distinguished Guests that Zambia is making tremendous strides in mitigating climate change. PS sorry, when you are back from Spain, pass through Chikoleka Forest areas and appreciate for your self how Zambia is doing the opposite in mitigating climate change. His Worship the Lusaka Mayor, Miles Sampa will be annoyed with himself that after some much publicized demonstrations of him planting some trees along Lumumba road and encouraging others to plant one or two in their areas, the opposite is the case few kilometers from his mayoral parlour. Has the Mayor not seen this as it is on his way to his residence. Or we should forgive him, he's always in a hurry to get home so that he can milk his lovely cows. He loves milk. So who's to blame. What's happening at that heritage site of Chikoleka Forest? And for that matter all the other Forests across the country reportedly being destroyed by human act and selfishness. When, on the cross,  as he received the drink, laced with bitter vinegar, Jesus Christ raised his head and in a loud voice shouted , IT IS FINISHED.

I would like to take this opportunity to respond to Hon Brian Mushimba’s fake statement made yesterday concerning the Mulungushi university payment issues and those students stopped from writing the exams. I expressly state that over 100 students have not yet been given an opportunity to seat for the exam and management is hiding behind the media by feeding them with fake news stating the matter has been resolved. The issue is far from been resolved, most students have not reached the needed 80% and only a few have attained the 50% threshold but the majority have not even made it to the 50% minimum requirement to seat for exam set by management. The 50% needed to seat for exam is about eleven thousand kwacha (K11,000 ) and what’s frustrating is that some of us have paid at least K10,000 kwacha but still denied the opportunity to seat for exams. Management has robbed us of money, considering the fact we opened 4 weeks late and only staying in school for 2 months.

THE PATRIOTIC FRONT AND MULUNGUSHJI UNIVERSITY MANAGEMNT ARE DECEIVING THE PUBLIC Dear editor, please hide my identity I am a fourth year student at Mulungushi University pursuing a bachelor’s degree in economics. I would like to take this opportunity to respond to Hon Brian Mushimba’s fake statement made yesterday concerning the Mulungushi university payment issues and those students stopped from writing the exams. I expressly state that over 100 students have not yet been given an opportunity to seat for the exam and management is hiding behind the media by feeding them with fake news stating the matter has been resolved. The issue is far from been resolved, most students have not reached the needed 80% and only a few have attained the 50% threshold but the majority have not even made it to the 50% minimum requirement to seat for exam set by management. The 50% needed to seat for exam is about eleven thousand kwacha (K11,000 ) and what’s frustrating is that some of us have paid at least K10,000 kwacha but still denied the opportunity to seat for exams. Management has robbed us of money, considering the fact we opened 4 weeks late and only staying in school for 2 months. We don’t understand the reasons to why we have not been refunded or understood the same way we did.

This cartel has seriously killed PF in eastern province and and at the same time  milking government at fastest late.  Others have called Vincent a commercial gambler when they awarded themselves a feeder road project about 22km to a cost of worth 87 Million Kwacha. Such similar roads of exorbitant prices are all over eastern and Chipangali district inclusive where each road was costing 1.2Million kwacha per 1km, just gravelling the road. From these projects funds and many funds that is said to have been gotten from other ministries like ministry of livestock, were a grant of fish farming and a grant of piggery project was gotten but did not reach Chipangali,and now want it to be used build a personal stadium in eastern province at Chipata old beit stadium, for personal gain.

They have prioritises every payment to a named company owned by Moses Moyo a UPND member and several other companies owned by Vincent Mwale Minister of Infrastructure Development.

Investigations are still at the initial stage but basic facts are that, on 26 August 2019, First Quantum directors acting together with their appointed directors in Kansanshi Mining Plc transferred $520 million USD belonging to Kansanshi Mine to a sister company known as First Quantum Minerals Finance Limited, without following laid down procedures and without the approval of the Kansanshi mining PLC Board.

The construction of the 321 kilometres stretch has been questionable from the onset when government pegged its cost at US$1.2 billion.  Construction experts estimate that the real cost is just around $600 million on average. Even the selection of the contractor was mired in corruption. China Jiangxi International, the firm constructing the road was not even among the six shortlisted bidders. It was through bribing government officials such as former infrastructure minister Ronald Chitotela that China Jiangxi International was awarded the contract at the expense of shortlisted bidders. It has now emerged that China Jiangxi International will actually spend just around $500 million to construct the 321-kilometre road but will receive the entire US$1.2 billion. Sources within China Jiangxi International have told the Watchdog that looking at the cheap, poor quality materials been hauled from China to the construction site and how tax is being evaded, the total money that will be spent is far much less that what the country has been told.  Sources say, beside the fact that it needs to make its own profit from the US$1.2 billion, China Jiangxi International needs a lot of cash to bribe government officials who now include the current minister of infrastructure Vincent Mwale. Readers will recall that when local and international experts questioned the exorbitant US$1.2 billion cost, the world was told that the dual carriageway, will also come with the construction of a transit hotel, service stations between Lusaka and Kabwe, and a mini city to be established between Kapiri Mposhi and Ndola, among other attractions. China Jiangxi Corporation president Xu Guojian added that “our corporation will construct a school and a hospital that will be handed over to the Government of the Republic of Zambia’ as part of the dual carriage way. But once China Jiangxi International started receiving the money, it dropped most of the promised amenities above but maintained the US$1.2 billion cost. Current minister of Housing and Infrastructure Development Minister Vincent Mwale who is in the pockets of China Jiangxi International has already announced that government had revisiting the contract for the Lusaka – Ndola dual carriageway.  Mwale announced that government has revisited the scope of works so that the existing road can be maintained, and only additional two lanes should be constructed. He said the idea of constructing additional projects such as Hotels, mini city and self-stations will be left out of the contract. He said nothing about reducing the project cost to factor in the reduced items. The depreciation of the Kwacha does not negatively affect the construction of the Ndola carriageway because the contract is couched in US Dollars and payment is made is US Dollars. If anything, the depreciation of the Kwacha favours China Jiangxi International because it pays its it labourers at the site in Kwacha. For example, if it spent $10 000 on salaries for local labourers in October and November, in December it will just spend $7000 but the amount will be the same in Kwacha. This is the same company that, with its agents Joseph Mwewa, Mulenga Sata, and Bwembya Chikwanda stole US25 million dollars meant for the modernisation of Lusaka International Airport. This they did by changing and reducing the Airport design in size and quality of building materials without tender authority. In short, they made smaller structures of cheaper materials than what was approved. Readers may also recall that the Office of the Public Protector (OPP) established a prima facie case of Maladministration against the Ministry of Housing and Infrastructure Development, concerning the US $1.2 billion Lusaka-Ndola Dual carriage way contract. That was four months ago. OPP said then that the Lusaka-Ndola Dual Carriage was a Private Public Partnership (PPP) Project but was later irregularly changed to a financing project. OPP Public Relations officer Chileshe Mwansa disclosed that after making inquiries, the institution established that originally the construction of the Lusaka-Ndola Dual Carriage was a Private Public Partnership (PPP) Project which was later changed to a financing project and a contract awarded to Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC). Mwansa said OPP established that the procurement procedure to give an opportunity to Companies that had bid for the project when it was initially a Private Public Partnership was not done after the change of project Contract to Engineering Procurement Construction. Mwansa said the public protector had instituted an investigation into the case in order to establish what transpired. You will never hear the findings of that inquiry. Remember, China Jiangxi was not one of the shortlisted bidders but bribed out the shortlisted bidders and it is still paying procurement officials and politicians for the ‘favour’. Hence it needs some of the money from the $1.2 billion to pay government officials in kickbacks. At the beginning of this project,International Trade researcher and consultant Trevor Simumba said that the $1.2 billion Lusaka-Ndola dual carriageway project was scandalous and corruption-tainted. “This project is scandalous, corruption-tainted project. The RDA must explain properly why it escalated from less than US$ 100 million (K930 million) to over $1.2 billion! The RDA also must explain what happened to the six preferred bidders that were invited under the Restricted Invitation in the above quoted RFP. Was China Jiangxi in that original list of six preferred bidders? If not, how did they become the sole bidder? What were the proposed project costs for the other six bidders? Which engineers conducted the final feasibility study, final engineering designs and the Bill of Quantities that led to this project cost? I believe these are very simple questions to answer, which would help us laymen understand better the justification for this colossal sum. I hope you can direct these queries to the RDA spokesperson and also to the government, including Finance Ministry,” Simumba said.       https://www.zambiawatchdog.com/china-jiangxi-to-spend-only-500m-on-ndola-dual-road-but-receive-1-2-b/,135,86,7,,10,27,5,64,2876260242424707,/story.php?story_fbid=2876260242424707&id=129987587052000

In Zambia the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) found that a handful of very high profile figures have apparently orchestrated and facilitated massive trafficking operations for years that are driving mukula rosewood trees to the edge of commercial extinction, devastating vulnerable forests and threatening communities’ livelihoods. Conservative estimates show that on average over 50 40- foot containers of mukula have been exported monthly from June 2017 to May 2019 (equivalent to over 2,000 cubic meters each month) in breach of export bans, according to EIA's analysis. This illegal trade generates a total of approximately US$7.5 million paid annually in bribes and informal “fees," as traffickers described to investigators. According to the traffickers met by EIA undercover investigators, prominent figures of the Zambian government and political sphere, including President Edgar Lungu, his daughter Tasila Lungu, Given Lubinda (Minister of Justice), and Jean Kapata (Minister of Lands and Natural Resources), are central figures in this illicit network.

With regards to Zambia, there are three major issues: 1. Fake news is broadly defined to include anything you don't agree with whether it is true or not, it is highly politicised. Anything that does not favour the ruling party is regarded as fake news by most of its members. Similarly anything that does not favour the opposition is regarded as fake news by most of their members.  2. When people are accused of malpractices during privatization, it's not fake news but when other people are accused of being involved in illegal mukula dealings, it's fake news and it harms the nation? When people are accused of practicing tribalism, it's not fake news but when others question amounts spent on fire tenders, roads and ambulances, it's fake news? When some people are accused of planning to introduce gay rights, it's not fake news but when others are accused of running the economy down and misappropriating public funds, it's fake news. Charity begins at home, if we really want to deal with fake news, our leaders should ban their supporters from  spreading fake news to harm their opponents.  Let's condemn everything that is 'fake news' and not just what we feel does not favour us.  3. The best way to deal with fake news is to fill the media space with good news. Good news comes from good governance and sound economic management. This is supported by vigorous development communication and promotion of good things that are being done. Rhetoric will not end fake news. Let's be sincere and work together to fight 'fake news'. Thank you. 🙏,161,138,4,18,1,,,35,2875155485868516,/story.php?story_fbid=2875155485868516&id=129987587052000

Mukula is a rare African tree and one of the rosewood species protected under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). Illicit and unsustainable harvesting of this precious timber has led to the destruction of Zambian forests, with environmental activists and the international community warning of a looming extinction. Multiple allegations appear in Mukula Cartel, a report by the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA), published late last week.  Traffickers allegedly told undercover EIA investigators that Tasila Lungu, daughter of President Edgar Lungu, is involved in the illegal trade of protected mukula timber, along with the Minister of Lands and Natural Resources, Jean Kapata, and the Minister of Justice, Given Lubinda. The state-owned company Zambia Forestry and Forest Industries Corporation Limited (ZAFFICO) is alleged to have used its mandate to trade logs seized from illegal traders as a cover to trade freshly felled mukula trees, in some instances under the protection of the Zambian army. ZAFFICO is also alleged to have issued fraudulent export certificates, allowing timber from the endangered trees to be exported to China through the South Africa port of Durban. EIA estimates that the illegal trade generates approximately US$7.5 million in bribes and informal fees annually. Rueben Lifuka, Vice-Chair of Transparency International and President of Transparency International Zambia said: “It is imperative that the claims made in this report are investigated by multiple agencies and offices. Not only mukula continues to be trafficked despite the outcry of the Zambian public and the international community, the sale of Zambia’s natural resources allegedly benefits only a few people at the highest level of the government.” Alarmingly, the report reveals that endangered trees are also used as a currency to influence Zambian elections. Traffickers told EIA investigators that President Lungu granted mukula permits to regional chiefs in exchange for votes from their provinces ahead of the 2016 election and accepted a US$40,000 “donation” from a powerful Chinese trader to buy expensive outfits for his re-election campaign. Rueben Lifuka continued: “This report describes the abuse of the state apparatus to facilitate and protect a criminal network operating at the highest levels of power. Such grand corruption thrives on the exploitation of natural resources for the benefit of the few, to the detriment of the many, and to their right to their natural heritage and environment.”   To restore the integrity of Zambia’s government and protect the remaining mukula trees, Transparency International urges: 👉🏾The Ministry of Lands and Natural Resources to urgently institute a complete ban on the export of mukula wood; 👉🏾The Zambian government to provide a full account of mukula traded through ZAFFICO, including information on revenues and how the funds have been expended; 👉🏾The Chief Justice of Zambia to establish a special tribunal to investigate the alleged illegality; The Zambian Anti-Corruption Commission to launch a full and thorough investigation into the findings of the EIA report; 👉🏾All relevant authorities, including the Anti-Corruption Commission and the Electoral Commission of Zambia, to investigate the legality of campaign donations and allegations of vote buying, and the abuse of state resources ahead of major Zambian elections. 👉🏾Transparency International also calls upon the South African government to investigate their end of the suspicious transit route in order to stop the flow of Zambian mukula wood from the port of Durban, which the report claims is now the principle point of departure for Zambian mukula from Africa since authorities in Tanzania have increased enforcement against trafficking.,641,539,49,24,6,19,4,222,2873969829320415,/story.php?story_fbid=2873969829320415&id=129987587052000

Yesterday, the Copperbelt University Academics Union threatened to boycott class today if their delayed November salaries are not paid and also accused university management of abrogating the law by not paying them on time.  In an interview with Phoenix News, Copperbelt University Lecturer’s Unions Spokesperson, Dr Derrick Ntalasha disclosed that the lectures have agreed to not attend class until their money is paid in full.  Further, Dr Ntalasha says this decision by the union is within the law and will be maintained until salaries are paid. Efforts to get a comment from CBU vice chancellor, Professor Naison Ngoma over the matter failed by broadcast time as his mobile phone went unanswered.

As per the tweet below. Its seems out president is sadly misinformed about his own country.  The images he tweeted are NOT a result of climate change. The Victoria Falls dries up seasonally and has been doing so forever. Not only is low water the cause of this but also because Zesco diverts whatever little water would flow over the falls to run their turbines below  the gorge. The Falls cliff is also higher on the Zambian side and so naturally the river would flow to the Zimbabwean side which is lower and that is why the Zimbabwean side of  the falls always has a constance flow all year round. The images the president tweeted makes its seem as though the entire zambezi had dried up which is hasn't and never has. Its quite unfortunate became false information like this has an impact on tourist travel in the area. We have also been pouncing on international media for their overexaggearted stories about the falls linking the lack of water to climate change when infact our own leader is not aware of the facts.UBUPUBA MU ZAMBIA BWACILA -  Saviour Chishimba There is too much ubupuba in how the country is being managed at the moment - UPP President Saviour Chishimba,284,215,45,2,3,16,3,84,2873065726077492,/story.php?story_fbid=2873065726077492&id=129987587052000

By: Anthony Bwalya - UPND Member Information has emerged that the Patriotic Front (PF) government plan to leverage political arrogance to hijack the Bulk Power Supply Agreement in respect of the Copperbelt Energy  Corporation (CEC) and throw it into the hands of vultures, most likely the Chinese, for the benefit of top government politicians.   With a combined infrastructure and asset value in excess of $500 million, corrupt PF politicians stand to pocket well over $50 million in bribes and kickbacks associated with any possible transfer of the energy monopoly from CEC to their preferred bidder. This is part of a long standing, calculated scheme by corrupt PF politicians to continue on their unrelenting and sworn path of peddling illegality for their own private benefit, and much at the expense of the wider economy.  This is why ZESCO has been dithering for close to a year to engage in constructive discussions with CEC for purposes of resolving the status of the BSA post March 2020 when it comes up for renewal. The truth is that this process is and has never been in the hands of ZESCO, but rather that it has been taken over by corrupt PF politicians wanting to illegally benefit from this multi million dollar agreement. This also begins to clarify the charge by the American Ambassador to Zambia Mr. Daniel Foote, who in his most recent statement, revealed that domestic politics have gotten in the way of constructive discourse involving a domestic energy reform plan drawn up with the assistance of energy experts from the United States of America. The truth is, all technical negotiations involving the energy sector are no longer handled by technocrats but by greedy PF politicians seeking a pay cheque from every single energy sector transaction.  This is the primary motivation of PF politicians to constructively disrupt the BSA in respect of CEC. But people must realise that the culture of illegally disrupting and taking over of both public and private entities under the PF, and handing them to their friends, those of whom are willing to pay them multi million dollar kickbacks to say thank you for the dirty work, is not new. They are at it (trying) at KCM, where a technical and business turnaround issue was turned into a highly charged political issue. So while corrupt PF politicians continue to syphon money out of KCM, jobs are being lost and household incomes placed in such needless peril. And once they are done with KCM, the economy would have lost hundreds of millions of dollars due to the reckless disruption of operations at KCM. The plan for the PF has always been to hand over as much mining control to the Chinese as possible. This is why the Chinese have taken up pole position in the possible takeover of KCM, and are presently leading the charge for the commencement of mining activities in the ecologically sensitive Lower Zambezi National Park. It is also now in the public domain, that corrupt PF politicians, including the presidency, facilitated the casual seizure of the Mukula business from local companies by illegally taking over legally harvested Mukula logs by legitimate permit holders, and illegally sold it to their Chinese friends. This resulted in the economy losing over $500 million in revenue due to underdeclaration of exports, as well as bribes. And it is these same people who are lining up ZAFFICO for a "constructive" take over using markets as a conduit. Today, while our local farmers are paying a premium for foreign fertilizers imported by friends of the PF, top government politicians are getting paid several millions of dollars for suffocating Nitrogen Chemicals of Zambia (NCZ); sacrificing several jobs and incomes for our local people.  These are criminals whose only intention is to benefit from the suffering of Zambians, and they couldn't care less. It is visible from the amount of money the Patriotic Front (PF) injects into buying votes and disrupting our sense of collective purpose. The PF are prepared to disrupt economic activity on the Copperbelt, jeopardizing jobs for our people; by politically interfering the BSA negotiations involving ZESCO and CEC, and instead senselessly allege that a listed entity is funding the activities of the UPND. Nothing short of political stupidity. And China, a country that has been a friend of the Zambian people for several decades, has now realised the duplicity of the PF government, and all signs are that China is now  almost ready to pull the plug on the PF and heighten it's financing due diligence; because the corruption of PF politicians is not only costing Zambians their economy, it is also costing China money.,110,98,,3,,9,,29,2872966926087372,/story.php?story_fbid=2872966926087372&id=129987587052000

Commenting on President Lungu’s statement during the Anti-corruption day themed ‘United Against Corruption’, where the President spoke out against graft in his written speech, Col Panji said if any one were to listen to President Lungu and did not know anything about Zambian, they would be clapping right now, praising the President as an ardent corruption fighter. However, Col Panji said the only unfortunate part was that there was a huge variance between what President Lungu read in his written speech against his actions over the matter, saying corruption actually started and ended with President Lungu. “It’s an insult to our intelligence. It’s a big joke. Unless there is seriousness from the President himself, from his heart, not reading that corruption is evil we won’t go anywhere,” he said. Col Panji said the fight against corruption must start with the first family itself, saying the President himself should explain the source of his wealth, while at the same time telling the Zambian people where his daughter, Tasila, was getting the money for all the projects she was currently undertaking, including fencing the over 3790 hectares Forest Number 70 in Sinda, Eastern Province. He said already there was a report from an American organisation revealing the wanton corruption in the Mukula illegal trade. “There are reports that the daughter is building shopping malls where there used to be police stations, what is he doing about it? She has spent a lot of money fencing Chimutengo Forest, these are things the President must table in his own house” Col Panji said. “Like us the children of Dr Kenneth Kaunda, you won’t hear of us being involved in illegalities or that we had fenced off forests or were building malls where there used to be police stations. Let him begin with his daughter, where is she getting the money from.” Col Panji said Article 52 of the Constitution of Zambia guided how ministers and members of parliament must behave, but under President Lungu, his ministers and permanent secretaries were involved and profiting massively from government projects. He said corruption was right in front of President Lungu, saying everyone in the PF, from the highest office to the lowest cadre were now scavenging for government projects. “Corruption starts with him and ends with him,” said Col Panji.,Owen Milasi and 1K others,955,72,50,4,5,1,219,2872882239429174,/story.php?story_fbid=2872882239429174&id=129987587052000

Letter by Mthoniswa Banda Dear Editor, LUSAKA 10/12/2019 - This morning my car fell into a ditch in the car park of Carousel Shopping Centre. There is a 1m by 1 m square hole cut right in the middle of the car park which has no warning tapes or markings that show the presence of this hole. When two cars are parked on both sides of the hole it is difficult for one to know that the available car park space has a hole on it. Unfortunately for me my front left wheel of my car went into this ditch. When I approached centre management office who are Lamasat Investment, the owners and managers of the Carousel Shopping Centre, to inform them of what had happened to me at the car park I was met by a very rude and un concerned manager. He told me it was not his concern that my car had fallen into a ditch and even if it was damaged I needed to sort that on my own. He said that it was my responsibility to make sure that I checked where I parked, even within his Shopping Centre. He even said if a person was injured within Carousel Shopping Centre as a result of their negligence it was not their responsibility to take care of the situation as every person visiting Carousel buildings was old enough to take care of themselves. This is sad thinking for a company managing a public place like a mall where hundreds of clients, men, women and children frequent. My appeal to the Lusaka City Council and Government is to inspect some of these business premises that have no sense corporate responsibility on the Zambians they serve. Most of these business premises have little or no social amenities for their clients and general public frequenting them.  They also have no security to protect and secure their clients and their property. Government should also review the safety measures being placed on these premises and ensure that these un caring owners are forced to insure against damage to clients and property while on their premises. If the rude and unconcerned attitude of management of Lamasat Investment is anything to go by, one wonders how their employees are treated and whether they would even be concerned with a death of an employee or customer happening on their premises.,114,89,2,,4,11,8,61,2871442429573155,/story.php?story_fbid=2871442429573155&id=129987587052000

The  Copperbelt University  Academics  Union (CBUAU) has  noted with  dismay,  the  failure by CBU  Management  and  Government  to  pay  Salaries  to  workers  at  CBU  for  the  month  of November  2019.  This  trend  of  delayed  salaries  at  the  Copperbelt  University  is  very disappointing  and  demoralising  to  the  workers.  The  Copperbelt University  Academics  Union (CBUAU) shall therefore, not entertain this scenario anymore. Why should we be reduced to beggars? According to the Employment Code Act 2019 section 66 subsection (2), the law is very clear on payment of employee wages and it states as follows “The wages of an employee shall be  paid  at  regular  intervals  not  being  later  than  the  5th day  following  the  date upon  which  they  fall”. In this case, workers should have been paid on  the  28th of November 2019. Therefore, Management has abrogated the law by not paying the workers  on time.  What  is  disheartening  is  that  most  students  have  since  paid their  2020  tuition  fees  but  we have  a  poor  management  that  is  misdirecting  these  finances to  the  construction  of “Toll Gates” at highly exorbitant and exaggerated costs  but  which do  not  add  any  value  to  the running of  the  institution. We  have  mentioned time  and  again, that  we  have  a  failed Vice Chancellor  and  management  at  the  Copperbelt  University  that  needs  to be  removed  for things to return to normal.  To  this  effect,  if  the  delayed November 2019 salaries are  not paid  by Today Tuesday, 10th December 2019. The scheduled classes that commenced on Monday 9th December will not be conducted as members will be busy sourcing money elsewhere to take care of their families. Our members will only resume normal activities once they are paid.  To this effect, all matters to do with Board of Studies meetings, Board of Examiners, Senate Examination  Committee and  classes  will  not  take  place until November 2019 salaries  are paid.  Just like any other parent, we have children to send to school and families to feed at our homes and this continued delay of salaries is unacceptable and immoral.  ISSUED BY DR.

This kind of grandstanding and comedy can only be familiar to a party that is losing relevance and identity like the PF.  For the record and for our citizens that don't know, Mr. Mbewe is currently based in the Provincial Capital of Southern Province, Choma District, where he freely plies his trade and businesses with the local people there. That is what all our  people regardless of ethnicity in the Province are known for.  Mr Mbewe owns 'Leon  Lodges and Hotels' in Southern Province and does all his PF politics from Choma without any difficulties from the local communities there. In fact, one would have expected Mr. Mbewe to be Southern Province's ambassador of peace by preaching to the other hardcore known PF tribalists, as revealed by the Commission of inquiry on Voting patterns, and the yellow pages of PF tribalism, on how he manages to conduct his activities in that region peacefully and without problems.  It is also note worth noting that the police have sanctioned such as a highly divisive exhibitionist behaviour, when they cannot allow citizens who want to protest against high levels of corruption, increased electricity loadsheding, high mealie meal prices, depreciation of the Kwacha, and other economic challenges being faced by citizens.

NOW SAYS LAZARUS BWALYA CHUNGU TO REMAIN AS PROVINCIAL CHAIRPERSON-DAVIES MWILA "When the President speaks that is the end of the matter - SG Davies Mwila" Luwingu, Monday 9th December, 2019 "When the President speaks on a party issue and gives a position that is the end of that matter. I first made a statement on the Ilambo loss and then the President made a statement. President Edgar Lungu being the head of the PF party has made a final position on the Ilambo loss. So Hon Chungu Bwalya remains the PF Northern Province Chairman. It is a closed chapter," PF Secretary General Davies Mwila said this when he met Lupososhi and Luwingu PF district, constituency and ward officials, MPs and councillors at Triple Blessings Lodge in Luwingu. We lost the Ilambo ward by election because of complacency among ward, constituency, district and provincial officials. We are used to winning so we thought it is business as usual. We also had a wrong campaign manager in the name of Lupososhi Council Chairman John Kwandangala who had never visited Ilambo ward ever since he was elected as Lupososhi Council Chairman. The people of Ilambo ward were bitter that he had neglected them since they voted for him. I have reliable and verified information that Lupososhi MP Hon Chungu Bwalya almost every weekend whenever parliament is in session. The other reason I have gathered is that the PF Lupososhi District Chairman and Constituency Chairman were barring people willing to help them campaign in Ilambo ward. Campaigning is teamwork. To carry out an effective and efficient campaign you need the help of everyone. Embrace everyone in campaigns and work as a team. The fact that you have served in the party for a very long time must not make you ineffective and inefficient. It must make you sharper because you have rich experience in the party. We cannot put all the blame on the Lupososhi MP or the Lupososhi Council Chairman because campaigning is a collective work. It is a collective responsibility. We must all ask ourselves what we could have done better. We must all get involved in campaigning for our party. Finally, my mission was to visit Chilubi district and encourage our members there were we lost our MP Hon Rosario Fundanga but I thought of passing here since you are on the way to Chilubi. I urge you to wake up and commit yourselves to party work and to stop thinking that holding a party position is an end in itself. Those positions you hold are for performing party work. Speaking earlier Lupososhi MP Hon Bwalya Chungu said," I am very sad, hurt and embarrassed for the Ilambo loss. I know there is no enough explanation I can give to explain the loss in Ilambo ward. We have disappointed the President, Secretary General, the Central Committee and all our PF supporters. They are all angry and sad. The President personally told me that he was very angry and disappointed with me. I, Chungu Bwalya MP for Lupososhi constituency and PF Northern Province Chairman I have taken full responsibility of the Ilambo ward loss. We are human beings. We are not perfect. We made mistakes. We have learnt from our mistakes and we are going to reorganize ourselves and re-strategize and soldier on. We can only beg for your forgiveness.

I wish to announce to the general public that the Firearms Amnesty will be coming to an end on 30th June, 2020. My appeal, therefore to the general public is that those still in possession of illegally acquired firearms should take advantage of the remaining period of the Amnesty to surrender them to the Police. In the same vein, I am reminding all those who have inherited firearms of their deceased relatives without following laid down procedure in changing ownership to deposit such weapons in the Public Ware House without delay or risk being arrested and prosecuted.   Police will soon conduct random    clean-ups in search of illegally owned firearms and all those that would be found wanting will be prosecuted accordingly and should have themselves to blame.

We are subjected to the everyday load shedding from about 5: 30 to sometimes 22 hours.  Today on arrival from work and as usual, there was no power at home until I received a visitor around 19:30 who altered me that all other houses in my neighbourhood had power. And yes after checking only my house didnt have power. My maid then confirmed that actually when power was being restored, she heard a zesco cable blow up in one of our neighbours home near our fence.  We made a complaint and it was duly recorded as an emergency and that we would be called.  The phone call from the phone number 0969168326 came at around 23:30 for the person to reach my house and take a casual look just at the fence and say " iyi nimailofye tukabomba"  I told him it was recorded as an emergency and should be treated as such. If they don't work at night, they should have not told us anything. Asked for the number of the supervisor who sent him, I was slapped with a have respect for people and he threatens to beat me up in my own yard at night while on the phone with his own supervisor who did nothing to keep the boy in check and that's how they drove off.  I went to their offices to explain that he did or saw nothing at my house, simply not earger to resolve the problem. All I was told was that it has to wait till tomorrow morning meanwhile I use a borehole for water at home. So now not only do I have no power at all but no water which we pump only at night when we have a few hours of power and a sanctioned threat of violence and insults from a zesco employee simply not willing to work.  Help us please, we have suffered more than enough.

If the report is false as claimed by Mr Lungu's surrogates, we challenge him to engange his international lawyers and  commence legal action against the publishers of the report. The allegations are very serious and there are provisions in our constitution which can trigger impeachment proceedings against Mr Lungu.  If Mr Lungu's lawyers are having challenges to locate the contact address of the EIA, they can engage the Zambian Embassy in Washington who will easily locate the address on which to serve the writs of summons.

The workers are also angry that information minister Dora Siliya has engaged a Deputy Director General without involvement of the Board and when the institution is financially constrained. Information has emerged that Siliya has employed Former Vodafone Zambia Chief Sales Officer, Amon Jere as Deputy Director General at the Zambia National Broadcasting Corporation (ZNBC). Jere has been associated with Siliya since the days she was Minister of Transport and  Communications and he was at Airtel under President Rupiah Banda.

He went on to explain that the village setup gave him the survival skills he needed to run the business he runs today. Today Mpoha is managing director of the savenda group of companies that started as a small family business with his wife Esther in 1997.  ‘Early on, my dream was to explore Africa, move to the city and build a better future for myself and my community, “says Mpoha whose companies have adopted a pan-Africa approach, hence the name Savenda an acronym  for Save Nations, Develop Africa.  It from this humble background that Savenda has today become one of the most talked about brands in Zambia.  “We started with only U$$1,000 which we used to buy and sell South Korean phones to the local market, focusing on anti-magnetic wave products,’ he says. From  the profits made with this initial investment, we increased our volume and started diversifying.” The small company that was incorporated on February 6,1997 has now morphed into a vibrant conglomerate that has since spread its tentacles to manufacturing, insurance construction, express printing, logistics solutions, medical supplies, mining services and risk assessment for ISO certification. Despite all this success, Mpoha wears a humble Demeanour and rarely appears at public functions,preferring instead to lead a private life.  Such has been Mpoha’s phenomental success story that even government officials feel that there is need for many indigenous Zambians to take a leading role in building Zambia’s economy.  Sometime this year, North- Western Province Minister Nathaniel Mubukwanu praised Savenda Management Services for the role the group of companies is playing in its corporate social responsibility programme. That was when Savenda made a contribution towards the hosting of the North-Western Province Investment and Trade Expo. ‘As government through the idea of hosting these expos, we want to see so many companies that are able to thrive and compete favorably within the liberalized economy of this country,” Mubukwanu said when he received a donation of K100,000 from Savenda General Insurance chief executive offer Irene Muyenga.  Savenda General Insurance is one of the Savenda Management services subsidiaries in the country.  Mubukwanmu further explained the importance of indigenous Zambians taking part in driving Zambia’s economy.  ‘Is it true that we want to see as much as we can get out of foreign investors, but again the sustainable development of any given country ought to be anchored on thelocal enterprise,” Mubukwanui emphasized.  Giving out to various communities has been a part of Mpoh’s life since his childhood.  Mpoha explains the genesis of his philanthropy. “It is as a child that I developed this passion for creating a positive difference in people s lives. This actually explains why Mpoha has been involved in many corporate social responsibility activities in the country. These include a donation of K200,000 to the central province Investment and Trade Expo last year, the hosting of the farmers golf tournament in Mkushi and the sponsorship of the Savenda Awards of Excellence at st  Mary s secondary school in Lusaka. The Savenda Awards of Excellence recognize academic excellence from grade eight to twelve and are aimed at helping raise the level of competition among pupils at the Catholic run schools. In November 2017, St Marys Secondary School careers master Davies Mubangu said that the Savenda Awards of Excellence had made a positive impact on the performance of pupils at the school. The Savenda awards began seven years ago and since then the pass rate for our pupils at both grade nine and twelve final exams has been excellent, said Mr Mubangu. Our school is among the best in this country in terms of pass rate, we would like to commend Savenda for being our dependable partner and we urge other corporate entities to come on board and emulate Savenda” Indeed Mpoha s spirit of giving back to the community is something that other corporate entities should learn from Zambia if Zambia is to make a positive impact in its development trajectory. Mpoha s business acumen and resilience is something to be admired by all start-up businessmen and women. He is a kind of person who can sell sand profitably in a desert; it is all about knowing how to package products. Recently the Savenda Group announced plans to venture into a new territory with the launch of ZAMBIA Fresh Lusaka Market Africa s first commission-agent and formal fresh produce market.  The market will offer a new and distinctive fresh market food hub experience and create a unique market model providing sustainable solutions to the fragmented African small scale horticulture sector. Mhoha here provides inspiring insight for this new project. Growing up in the village I quickly realized what a challenge it is for farmers to bring their products to market he says, As a business we have developed market with a specific focus on aggregating small-scale farmers products to bring them to market. Mpoha told the economist that by aggregating their products and ensuring the right quality controls farmers will get a chance to sell their products in a hygienic market environment with real price discovery and transparency while consumers get fresh and locally grown food. The magazine also describes Mpoha s rise to the top drawer of the business world as a true representative of the talent that Zambia has to offer. But how did Mr Mpoha learn the ropes for what would later become an inspiring business journey? I first worked for a packaging company before joining a caterpillar plant for about ten years. This is where I not only got familiar with how to run a successful business but also got to know the running of several industrials such as milling and manufacturing he says. During this period we got to understand the business models that would eventually inspire us to build a multi-industrial conglomerate savenda . The Savenda group has continued to grow from strength to strength and is now a global supply chain management company with a network of partnerships in the united state of America, Europe the Middle East and the Asia-pacific region. It is not by accident that from the initial transaction of U$$1,000 in 1997, the Savenda group has grown to an estimated U$$200 million.,581,521,,49,11,,,103,2868601686523896,/story.php?story_fbid=2868601686523896&id=129987587052000

Well, it turns out that it’s a hoax - fake news. That 4000 included Kitwe DC, Binwell Mpundu and many hardworking civil servants who had been transferred to other parts of the country but had maintained Copperbelt as their pay point. After the Payroll was run for the November salaries, the salaries for the purported ghost workers were not processed. After payday, these workers were forced to travel to Lusaka at Smart Zambia offices for them to be paid their delayed November salaries.

And Mpankata said the party should begin to respect the senior and old members, as the general feeling within the PF was that they did not receive the respect due to them. Speaking with Daily Revelation on the ultimatum party secretary general Davies Mwila had issued to the party’s provincial chairperson Lazarous Chungu, who is also Northern Province minister and Lupososhi member of parliament to vacate office, as it was unacceptable for the opposition UPND to win an election in his area, Mpankata said it was really sad for the ruling party to lose an election in its birth place. “It’s a serious indictment on how the SG could be running the party. Let him do an introspection of the party, how is he running the party, him being CEO of the party? Why are people running away from us?” Mpankata asked. He said the Lupososhi seat gave impetus to the late leader Michael Sata after he won his first parliamentary seat for the PF there when others least expected him to. Mpankata said being the first ever member of parliament for the PF he resisted the temptation of a ministerial appointment from then president Levy Mwanawasa when he was dismantling the opposition. He said Mwanawasa appointed Sylvia Masebo from ZRP, resulting in the end of that party, in the same manner the Heritage Party and FDD fell when their members of parliament were appointed into government. Mpankata said he remained because he believed in the ideals of Sata, but it was sad how people wanted to destroy the party which loyalists had built over a long time.

The Zambia Roads & Highway Safety Group is also calling on owners of public service vehicles such as trucks and buses to help sensitize members of the public on how to help their crew in the event of their vehicles catching fire during an accident. The Zambia Roads & Highway Safety Group notes that these accidents have occurred in the Nyimba area between 70km and 85km west of the Nyimba Boma. According to our count based on police and media reports, between May and first week of December, 2019, fourteen (14) lives have been lost in 5 road traffic accidents in this Nyimba stretch of the Great East Road. “On 7 December, a driver lost his life and was burnt to ashes in the same area of Nyimba. In May another truck driver was burnt to ashes in an accident involving 2 trucks and a bus. In June, 3 people died including a couple in a head on collision with a truck while in July in Kasusu area of Nyimba 4 people died when a truck they were in overturned. In October a truck careered off the road and fell into the ditch killing 5 and injuring one person. A total of 14 people have perished in this stretch alone this year,” says Zambia Roads & Highway Safety Group Admin Mthoniswa Banda. “Our appeal therefore is for the Government to take these accidents seriously and summon on site all the road safety and road management agencies to look at all the possible causes of accidents on this new stretch of the road, which we believe have to do with road design, slippery of the road and poor road signage,” says Group Admin Mthoniswa Banda. “We also note the poor response rates of the emergency vehicles and lack of first aid skills by first responders. This leads to many accidents victims dying of lack of attention. Zambia needs a rapid response to accidents to save lives of the accident victims,” says Group Admin Mthoniswa Banda. On trucks, drivers and goods on Zambian roads getting burnt to ashes while first responders look on haplessly, the Zambia Roads & Highway Safety Group is urging the bus and truck companies to create awareness on the public on how to help the truck and bus company crews put off fires and help save goods and lives during these accidents. “We are saddened by the sight of powerlessness by the first responders on the accident scene as they watch vehicles, goods and even fellow Zambians trapped in these vehicles burn to ashes,” says Mthoniswa Banda. The Zambia Roads & Highway Safety Group (ZRHSG) is an online road safety group with over 1,990 members and is for sharing experiences and knowledge on road safety and defensive driving on Zambian roads and Highways by road users. These discussions will help identify road safety issues, bad policies and bad road designs requiring improvement by government and its agencies such as RTSA, RDA, NRFA, ZP and local councils. Every week, the ZRHSG will produce a statement summarising the group discussion and sharing this opinion with Road Safety agencies and other policy makers so they improve Zambia’s Road Safety.

(And am keeping my word).  Audio recording extract from voice to written words Sorry Musamba. You got me on my way to an important meeting. House of  BLVXK basically is a conduit that was created by PF to run the 2016 elections. It was actually managed by Amos Chanda and it was conduit were money was landing to pay all the media houses.  So, if you saw the way the elections were done.  Oscar Chavula of HOT FM was always flying with the president and were always covering Edgar’s rallies everywhere across Zambia. It is exactly were he was getting the monies from as well. If you ask me, how I know this? It is because we have a radio station (won’t mention town) and we also got the money too through the same office. I was actually basically the one that got to broker those deals for our radio station.  So house of BLVXK is basically a media team that does all the media campaign for PF prior to any elections. So I can confirm that even 2021 the plan has already started. So for the sake of not blowing up the names of other guys in  it, I can’t mention the names for now, but I know the current presidential press aide and Tasila Lungu are leading the team. Are building a media team totally different and independent from the bullshit and nonsense of abena Sunday Chanda and Antonio Mwanza. They are no way near it. So like it was then Amos Chanda managed it and a lot of money moved around, got to be given to bribe radio stations, to black out opposition or other political candidates. So if you see what basically happened in 2016 elections. HH never received favourable coverage. Prior to that were media houses labelled as very critical of govt, those were target and paid lots of money, also instructed not to air any opposition materials even if it is paid for. So if you were to chase HH for example? Give him a very huge bill cannot afford.  I think if you ask the guys in UPND what Oscar gave HH then in the elections and the quotation he gave him was too huge and HH refused. That was basically profiteering and were no where near the standard rates a radio station can give. If the agenda would be to do the same things. You will see cases e.g with HOT FM Zambia, HH yes would be given audience but it will be a very minimal audience compared to PF, because are compromised and tide to a underhand contract that will be signed and will be paid a lot of money.  And this guys will go to whatever length to deal with and embarrass those with opposing views to PF in the case of what happened to Lindah Kasonde the other day, despite  HOT FM ZAMBIA knowing Tutwa had a different Bill 10 not submitted, he was debating from, as to what Linda had.  So House of BLVXK are regrouping and going to spend money and I mean lots of it. Coming from deals of corrupt Chinese, Lebanse and every minister that want to remain relevant and readopted . It’s a big thing basically money from the corrupt Chinese deals.  In 2016 the money used was profit from Mukula money the corrupt Chinese then that were involved in smuggling it were told as a reward that they drop bags of money at House of BLVXK.  I tell you we queued up, I was there, SUN FM owner was there, the Munyama brothers, Oscar was equally there, Kenny Tonga was there. Basically all the big boys in the radio media industry were there.  So in 2021 those who are objective will be fair with their coverage and those who are not objective, will take the money again and completely block out UPND.  So that’s what House of BLVXK is all about. It is an evil thing to even exists in Zambia.

By James Kasanda Musendeka Lukuku RPP President On Tuesday President Lungu is scheduled to visit northern province and pay a courtesy call on the Chitimukulu. This is not a normal schedule but a calculated move to mutilate democracy. GBM who has just returned from South Africa is already in talks with the upnd counsellor who just won for upnd in LUPOSOSHI to resign and join PF so that a fresh election is arranged. We are disturbed with the PF appetite to remain in power at all costs. The LUPOSOSHI vote for upnd has demonstrated that we can have a turn in the distribution of the voting pattern which is a very positive expectation in as far as fighting regionalism and tribalism in elections is concerned. Don't rape our democracy. We appeal to GBM and President Lungu to desist from tempering with democracy. It will be retrogressive should this orchestrated plan to porch a new upnd counsellor in northern province to the PF go on. If the PF can't accept this simple ward defeat, it will be difficult for them to accept the pending exit door in 2021. Insoni ebuntu. It's unfortunate that this resignation is planned to take place after a courtesy call on the Chitimukulu. This will stand to compromise the respect and independence of our chief.

The workers are also angry that information minister Dora Siliya has engaged a Deputy Director General without involvement of the Board and when the institution is financially constrained. Information has emerged that Siliya has employed Former Vodafone Zambia Chief Sales Officer, Amon Jere as Deputy Director General at the Zambia National Broadcasting Corporation (ZNBC). Jere has been associated with Siliya since the days she was Minister of Transport and  Communications and he was at Airtel under President Rupiah Banda. Siliya has created a new position of Chief Operating Officer, to deputise new ZNBC DG, Malolela Lusambo. This was after  attempts to make him DG failed. Amon abandoned the loss-making Vodafone Zambia, after government rejected their application for a voice calls licence and has received a soft landing through this placement. The position has not  been funded and has not been approved by the Mulenga Kapwepwe Board. Siliya has also shunted Rose Chumpuka as Director of Programs, and removed her role as Director News and Current Affairs. The position has been given  to Oswald Mutale, who supported Guy Scott together with Isaac Chipampe, during the Edgar Lungu/Guy Scott intra-party fighting. ZNBC is fighting for  its life after its major source of revenue, the TV levy collected by ZESCO, was taken to the Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA).

He further questions the doctrine of a Christian nation exporting marijuana and the potential spillover effects on the Zambian society. We think that the aspect of legalising marijuana will undoubtedly spike criminality levels and add a new dimension of addiction to the substance abuse among the youths. We think that the debate on the legalisation of Marijuana has not been exhaustive.  This is a critical issue involving society and cannot be willynilly be decided by a few elements intending on legally exporting the substance without considering the ramifications and the ultimate spillover effect in the environment and subsequently in the region. Arguably, legalising marijuana will undoubtedly attract global criminals who will setup camps here and escalate violent drug crimes. We think that this delinquent government needs a rethink on the legalisation of the substance rather than just the profiteering motive. They’re indeed grave consequences to such hurried and premature crafting of such legislation. No bonafide self-respecting Christian nation can allow for the cultivation and export of Marijuana because it destroys and ruins lives.It is absolutely leaving a lie. We think that this piece of legislation is a prelude to a violent society defined by lawlessness and addiction to substance abuse. Gayism and legalisation of Marijuana go hand-in-hand and are both offshoot of moral decay in any given society. Marijuana will ultimately render the majority of young people into cabbages and spike the numbers of those requiring mental health treatment. In my submission Marijuana does more criminal damage to society than it benefits it. It is not too late to withdraw this ill timed legislation.  We think that the disadvantages of legalising marijuana by far outweighs any realistic long term benefits as ultimately consumption of the substance becomes normal and widespread. We think that we are not equipped to handle the resultant violence  arising from the consumption of the substance. We think that it is the desperation to make money that has driven this morally bankrupt and corrupt government to resort to selling the long outlawed substance. In totality we condemn the legalisation of Marijuana in Zambia regardless of any short term benefits to the Country.

Well, it turns out that it’s a hoax - fake news. That 4000 included Kitwe DC, Binwell Mpundu and many hardworking civil servants who had been transferred to other parts of the country but had maintained Copperbelt as their pay point. After the Payroll was run for the November salaries, the salaries for the purported ghost workers were not processed. After payday, these workers were forced to travel to Lusaka at Smart Zambia offices for them to be paid their delayed November salaries. It has since turned out that only a tiny fraction of that figure, are indeed ghost workers. That explains why PF officials have suddenly gone quiet on this matter. Martine Mtonga, a Rupiah Banda protégé should apologies for alarming the nation. A young man at Cabinet office, an assistant director for PAYROLL by the name of Musopelo was even arrested to help police with investigations on the 4000 ghost workers. He spent about four nights in Police Cells and was released without charge. Many of his work colleagues were also harassed by Police and other government investigative wings who was sent by Mtonga.

Today it's not surprising that my brother Kalaba wants to be President. As we have mentioned many times, leadership in Zambia is a career opportunity, a get-rich-quick scheme for candidates and a cartel for the greedy. Those who have been there will do anything to get back in because of the economic rewards that come with these leadership positions. Kalaba has shown us that there is no intergrity or sanity in the Edgar Lungu led Cabinet and that is why it's not strange that the President himself has become so rich in a very short space of time, not that he's not entitled to become rich. This is what drives the politicians who run government today. Their passion for personal gratification is so great that if they shared it with the rest of the citizens, no Zambian would go hungry or fail to access good medical services today. We would not be surprised if this is the passion behind Kalaba's quest to become President. What my brother Kalaba should be telling the nation is how much he personally benefitted from overruling ZEMA's environmental assessment and subsequent advise on the proposed mining project in Lower Zambezi and how much each of those in Cabinet at that time benefitted because this was clearly a decision which was not in the interest of the nation. Zambians are now tired of educated explanations. We cannot have people who abetted wrong decisions trying to justify why we should elect them as leaders just because they are out of government now. It is these same people who  together with the Minister of Injustice  have vehemently ignored the Constitutional Court's ruling to pay back the money they obtained illegally while campaigning in 2016.  Today, many names are tied to the sale of Lower Zambezi and tomorrow some of these names will be in government and they will continue to make similar bad decisions. Today Zambia is in a shit hole of debt because of these same leaders and that is why they have been religiously pushing for Bill No.10 so that they can obtain more loans and get kick backs without being questioned by Parliament. This type of leadership is nauseating to say the least, its sickening and when people call for change, they are totally justified. We cannot continue on this destructive path as a nation.  The real enemy of Zambia is not the Chinese or Australian investor. The real enemy of Zambia are it's own leaders, it's own Ministers and it's own Cabinet. We are running a country with failed institutions and immoral leaders who have used their education to steal from the Zambian people. They have deliberately weakened public institutions so that they exploit the nation. These are the people we call 'Honorable'.These are the people who have commercialised leadership. These are the people who have sunk Zambia beyond repair and they do it without shame and with the confidence of a cockroach in the kitchen and proudly flying the Zambian flag on their ministerial vehicles. Some of them have been in nearly all governments, only changing the branding on their regalia and the type of rhetoric. To them its parte after parte because of scandal after scandal. Impi rightly sang 'Twelengayepo, tutontonkanyepo. Ba ntalamisoka balaonaula ichalo cha kwa Jehovah wesu'. We have One Zambia but Two nations, one for the elitist leaders and one for the rest of us. It is now up to Zambians to play the game right and begin to correct the many wrongs these bandits have created.

It was dubbed “the Future of Economic Diplomacy. Supporting Inclusive Growth and sustainable Development in Africa”. President Lungu and other foreign dignitaries graced the occasion which was also attended by many business executives.   I was invited to the conference. However, my conscience did not allow me to participate so I stayed away. Why?  EAZ hosting a conference is totally in order and is good. EAZ has been doing that since, from my recollection, the 1970s. Such meetings provide a good platform for discussing economic and other national issues. But the importance of EAZ must now, as before, extend beyond being mere organizers of economic conferences. Anyone, including professional organizers of all types of conferences are able to organize such.  Beyond conferences, the public also expects to hear well-reasoned, professional and coherent statements from EAZ on the key economic issues of the day. In this regard, EAZ is expected to stand in the same league as other professional associations.  When there are important legal issues in the land, the public look forward to statements from the Law Association of Zambia (LAZ) to give direction. Same for other institutions like the Press Association of Zambia (PAZA) for press issues, and the Engineering Institute of Zambia (EIZ), for engineering issues, etc.  Sadly, it is that professionalism; the well-reasoned and coherent voice from EAZ on public economic issues that I miss these days. To the contrary, some statements coming from EAZ are greatly disturbing. This is not to say that there should be no differences in opinions among economists. Those will be there and it is healthy that it is so. However, there are certain things where honest differences should be narrow, if there have to be there at all. Here are a few examples of positions taken by EAZ that have been troubling and, in my opinion, should not have led to differences in opinions from others.   Firstly, take the issue of the national indebtedness. Since 2013 the economic fraternity has been cautioning the Zambian government against the pace at which the country was borrowing. They advised the government to slow down on borrowing, both from the external and the domestic sources. The fraternity giving cautionary advice included local economists. Advice also came from reputable international bodies like the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the African Development Bank, and indeed from the world financial media.  Shockingly, EAZ was very loud in stating that it did not see anything wrong with the growing debt problem that the other economic groupings were seeing. EAZ told the government that its debt parameters were alright. Yet, because the government was continuing to borrow strongly the parameters were deteriorating rapidly. Zambia’s indebtedness has now spiraled out of control, a development which has once again been confirmed by the Board of the IMF last week. Today, the heavy national indebtedness has become Zambia’s biggest national economic problem. The effects of the debt crisis in Zambia are now evident even to the non-economists. As more money has been used for debt service, less has remained in the country for other important uses. In fact, the only reason why the government has not defaulted on debt is because it is suppressing funding for national domestic priorities. Last week, Parliament approved supplementary budget for the year 2019 to the tune of K9.8 billion. Two thirds of this new spending will be utilized for servicing debt. Where will this money come from? Not from new taxes revenues but from cutting expenditure lines across most ministries. The details of what will be cut are not available. The general story from this supplementary budget therefore is that ministerial and provincial budgets are being cut to accommodate debt servicing. In many rural schools, children are failing to attain learning targets because there is no money to hire enough teachers. The ques of the separated government workers awaiting to be paid their terminal benefits is getting longer. Government is failing to offer public sector workers sensible salary increments commensurate with the risen cost of living. Employees of some public institutions, including those from universities where ironically many members of EAZ are employed are having to endure delays in the payment of their salaries.  Various services from the government are failing. All this is because debt servicing is taking most of the government money, leaving too little for everything else.  For all this EAZ advised the government that the debt parameters were ok.  It is reasonable to assume that part of the reason why the government continued to strongly borrow in spite of the contrary advice from many quarters was that it accepted the opinion of EAZ, a local professional association, to the effect that the country’s debt parameters were still in order. If this was indeed the case then EAZ would qualify to be an accomplice in bringing about our debt crisis and all its negative consequences. A second issue is on the ongoing dispute with the mining firm, Vedanta and public approach to mining in general. As far as I can tell, Vedanta has had serious challenges endearing itself to its mining communities. Not surprisingly, it has had few, if any, to sympathize with it. But many people rightly worry about the approach the government is using in handling the affair; and whether the approach is robust enough to stand legal challenges from Vedanta. A procedural error in handling the stand-off has the potential to bring about huge costs in compensation, a result that could undo the financial benefits of the intended divorce with the company.  Particularly worrying during this episode is a story attributed to the President of the EAZ. The report says “President of the Economics Association of Zambia Lubinda Habaazoka has suggested that Zambia should nationalize some mines without compensation. Dr. Habaazoka contended that nationalization of the country’s mining assets can lead to economic growth” (Lusaka Times July 22, 2019).  I have not seen any denial of the story so I assume the statement is true.  This statement suggesting nationalizing some mining assets without compensation was made less than a week before the EAZ hosted the international conference in Livingstone on Zambia’s ailing economy. Among the stated objectives of the conference was to show case Zambia as an attractive investment destination. The suggestion to nationalize mines without compensation when you are hosting a conference to attract investors is definitely a big contradiction that will undo one of the objectives of the conference. This is troubling because why bother to attract investors on one hand while threatening to national business assets without compensation on the other? The list of troubling positions taken by EAZ on the Zambian economy does not end here. But, in closing, we touch on one more item albeit very briefly. This is on the replacement of VAT by sales tax which the association championed against the opinion of most business houses and relevant professional associations. The newly appointed Minister of Finance has opted to stop the change-over as of now while studying the matter further. Supposing, at the conclusion of the review, the Minister decides to retain the VAT, will EAZ now shift to praising VAT instead of the sales tax that they have been praising? Regarding the just ended conference itself, EAZ left the impression that the organization is still struggling to appreciate and believe that there is a debt crisis in the country whose effects are biting already.  Not only was the matter not given the sufficient attention it deserves. But ironically also, EAZ presented a long list of national needs and requirements and urged the government to finance those items. Really? At a time when there are arrears on salaries for some public workers? When we are unable to employ enough teachers? When there are many infrastructure projects abandoned mid-way for lack of funds?  When the country is failing to fund public universities? Amidst all this EAZ adds additional items requiring financing without stating where savings can be made. Would it not have been more prudent for EAZ to help the government and the public at large to get into a discussion of how to arrive at intelligent ways of setting priorities for funding when money is tight? This absence of a spirit of prioritizing in EAZ is disappointing. EAZ needs to understand that the general public perceive it as the voice of the respected, pragmatic and sensible economic consensus. As a professional association, they are uniquely placed to praise or to criticize anyone based on sound professional arguments.  That privileged position should however be used very carefully so that now, as before and in future, the association should be seen to be have views that the public can depend on for pragmatic economic direction.  An economist friend from my generation said of the Livingstone conference: “I cannot go there and be seen to be endorsing the thinking of the current EAZ”. It was like he and I had telepathic reflections on the matter.,877,789,9,65,9,5,,221,2611751118875622,/story.php?story_fbid=2611751118875622&id=129987587052000

When stripping the provisional liquidator of his powers, the judge had said that she would hear from both parties on July 4 to determine whether KCM should be wound up. But the PF demons went to work immediately piling unprecedented pressure on the poor judge who was left with no choice but to do as the state wants.

Milingo Lungu was appointed as a provisional liquidator to wind up KCM during an ex-parte court hearing, that is, without other interested parties being given a chance to state their case.  But now Judge Bobo Banda has stayed (cliped) almost all the important powers of the provisional liquidator until the court makes a final decision on the liquidation of KCM. Among the powers that have been taken away from Milingo is the power ‘to make any compromises or arrangements with [KCM] creditors.’ The court has also forbidden the provisional liquidator from making ‘any agreements on all questions in any way relating to or affecting KCM or its assets’. Milingo Lungu, the provisional liquidator has also lost the power to sell or dispose of buildings, cars, machinery and other any other property belonging to KCM. The court has set 4 July 2019 as the date on which all parties, the provisional liquidator and his team and the genuine owners of KCM will be heard together in court.,236,189,23,1,4,16,3,116,2536477679736300,/story.php?story_fbid=2536477679736300&id=129987587052000

Addressing the media in Lusaka , ZICA president Jason Kaziliman says contrary to attacks on fic by some stakeholders, focus should be on arresting those involved in the reported illegal financial transactions. Mr. Kaziliman has wondered how publication of the trends report can jeopardize the operations of other investigative wings as suggested by the drug enforcement commission-dec- when no names are made public.  Meanwhile, Mr. Kaziliman has observed that the sales tax amendment bill in its current form could lead to an escalation in prices of goods and services up to 9% through the cascading effect of sales tax along the value chains of goods and services.  Mr. Kaziliman has joined other stakeholders in urging government to change the implementation date of sales tax to January 2020 so as to enable any required systems changes to be made and allow a period for better budgeting and forecasting with known sales tax rates. Government has proposed July 1st 2019 as the effective date for sales tax implementation. PHOENIX NEWS,308,273,23,9,2,1,,46,2510558692328199,/story.php?story_fbid=2510558692328199&id=129987587052000

You can’t sleep properly because you are expecting that much dreaded call from Plot1, MOF, the Board or from anywhere including inquisitive friends and relatives! I call it “The Fear Factor”,  “The Sembe Moments”! ZRA-CG Kingsley Chanda and Chanda Nyela (Both Bemba’s from Chinsali District) Private Telephone Conversation has already gone viral and haywire on Social Media! My take on that conversation! I listened to all the recordings yesterday and today. I’m a concerned citizen of Zambia. Disclaimer Caveat.  I don’t know Chanda Nyela and I know nothing much about him. I personally know Kingsley Chanda the current ZRA CG and since he currently holds a Public Office In trust on behalf of we the People of Zambia, I’m tempted to share my thoughts. No malice, mischief or injury intended. No love lost. I stayed with KC on the same 1st Floor as Neighbours when he came as a Fresher and I was in 4th year at UNZA in 1989/90. That was Kwacha 1 in Room 22 ku Ruin pa UNZA.  We worked together when KC was with SGS and I was with GRZ. We were neighbours in Woodlands and friends/colleagues. We have chilled together at O’hagans, Shakas, Inters and Mulungushi. Lol!  Firstly, the CG should not have been discussing ZRA Policy matters with an outsider. Board should be concerned. ZRA CG should not be disclosing ZRA operation of Smuggling things from Nakonde Boarder via Livingstone with an outsider - Chanda Nyela! The Board should review and determine. ZRA CG must not have brought in Political Parties in such a conversation - PF and UPND.  ZRA doesn’t or should not treat Zambian citizens and Tax Payers, Tax Evaders or Smugglers based on Political Affiliations. PR Damage control has a mammoth task to correct the impression created in that conversation. ZRA CG  Kingsley Chanda and Chanda Nyela should Not have brought in Nepotism, Chinsali (Wako ni Wako Tribal talk) just because one of the alleged ZRA facilitator of the Smuggling Rings In Nakonde using Livingstone Boarder hails from Chinsali.  As KC indicated, let the internal Disciplinary process take its own course. CG should not even come anywhere near the process now after stating he would see after the process. He must recuse himself even during the appeal process. ZRA CG must not have expressed Political inclination towards PF by proclaiming affinity to PF. ZRA CG proclamations that those Smugglers are using UPND supported-operated clearing Agencies for their intended mischief of Tax evasion requires Policy Directives that Office bearers become Apolitical. One would think ZRA staff Are Apolitical.  Should not discuss Politics even if they believed in Mulyokela’s Manifesto. Finally, the ZRA CG was too quick to disclose ZRA case details to a PF Cadre Bemba chap from Chinsali known as Chanda Nyela (The Need to Know Basis and Policy May have been breached and MOF & Board May have to review)! But again maybe expecting Professionalisms and Professionals not having Political Inclination May be asking for too much in our Motherland land! Ise ni so chabe! I wish the ZRA CG can extricate himself and come out clean on this one and learn some very important and salient lessons from this.  It would be a near miss!

On Saturday, Lusambo posted on Facebook boasting that he had donated 4000 bags of mealie meal, 4000 litres of cooking oil and other assortments to his constituency.  Civil society activist laura Miti wrote  How did Bowman Lusambo get this rich? To make this donation, Lusaka Minister, Bowman Lusambo, had to pay something in the region of K1million from his own pocket. Now, we all know that, in 2011, Mr Lusambo was an MMD cadre with no money whatsoever. This means he has somehow, since assuming office, become arguably richer than the government he serves in. Remember, government is so broke that it is failing to meet its financial obligations. Simple question is how has Mr Lusambo made this money? Keep in mind that according to FIC reports, over K15 billion of public money has disappeared in illicit transactions in the last 3 years. By this post, I am asking Minister Lusambo to explain how he became so rich as to afford this donation. I am also asking the President to get the ACC to investigate this donation. I ask because this, to the uneducated eye, looks like a Minister with money in amounts which cannot be supported by his known earnings. I also ask because we citizens are tired of seeing politicians show off inexplicable wealth while the rest of us can barely hold things together.

It is clear that there has been a long-standing problem at KCM and finally the PF administration has woken up to the reality of the plight of the miners and residents of Chingola and surrounding towns on the Copperbelt. The problems facing the employees and mine suppliers of KCM as well as the residents of Chingola will get worse before they get better. KCM needs new owners with a vision, a plan and money to restart the right mining operations and to maintain the smelter capacity that has been operated by Vedanta. The PF lacks the capacity to provide the guidance necessary to bring relief to years of mismanagement and decline in one of the richest corners of the country. Let us not be fooled into thinking that the PF cares one bit for the people of Chingola. The strategy of appointing a connected person to overseer the liquidation process is based purely on a survival instinct and a fear that a collapsing economy, joblessness and the rampant theft of public resources all present a perfect storm for a government that is on its way out of office and has no clue about how to recover the years of punishing abuse that it has inflicted on its people. The only hope for the people of Chingola, the Copperbelt and the nation at large, is for Zambians to finally realise that keeping the PF in power presents a grave danger to the survival of our nation. With state-backed violence, state capture and corruption on the grandest scale in our history; and with state borrowing at levels that cannot be sustained due to the rampant indiscipline of our current leaders, it is only a matter of time before we collapse into near-irriversible economic ruin. A new owner of the mine must be found immediately. This is probably what lies at the heart of the action that has been taken by the PF government. It is clear that the economy is in a mess. This is largely because of the reckless manner in which our sovereign loans have been applied in building overpriced infrastructure, equipment and services. It is not beyond the PF administration to attempt to write off some Chinese debt in exchange for KCM's business operations or to deliver the mine to pre-determined Russian or Western interests. This may be the real reason behind the current manoeuvres, given the suspicious ties PF has been cultivating over the years. What is abundantly clear, however, is that without a new owner and without sound economic planning and disciplined public expenditure, there will be massive layoffs, further suffering and further decline of our mining areas on the Copperbelt. The PF have appointed a provisional liquidator with no skill or experience in finding solutions to the long-standing problems facing Chingola and KCM. They must replace him with a competent team that can bring sanity to this desperate situation. In the same way, Zambians also appointed a leadership with no skill or experience in finding solutions to the problems we face as a nation. In 2021, they must replace them with a team that has a heart for the nation and a vision and principles that can restore the pride of our nation. Elias C.

The Forum was initially supposed to have finished sitting on Wednesday 8th May 2019 but was granted a three days extension by the Ministry of Justice which was to expire tomorrow Saturday 11th May 2019. The latest extension of another three days means the Forum will continue sitting up to Tuesday 14th May 2019 after adopting draft Bills, that is if they will not request for another extension. NDF Secretary Patrick Chisanga has confirmed that Justice Minister Given Lubinda has agreed to grant the three days extension adding that the NDF will formally write to the Ministry of Justice over the extension. Mr Chisanga stated that there are many outstanding issues that need to be addressed by the delegates. Apart from tampering with the constitution in the name of making amendments, the NDF is also coming up with the political parties Bill and amending the 1955 Public Order Act (POA) which is promising to be worse than the current one which is always abused by the government to disadvantage opposition political parties and people with divergent views. The NDF was initially supposed to finish all its business in ten (10) days. Under the amended POA people who fail to sing the national anthem at public gatherings risk a jail sentence not exceeding two years. https://www.zambiawatchdog.com/national-dialogue-forum-sittings-extended-by-another-three-days/,73,59,12,,,1,1,70,2447882225262513,/story.php?story_fbid=2447882225262513&id=129987587052000

If the funds are disbursed, they’ll increase the southern African nation’s external debt to $12.7 billion, from $10.1 billion at the end of 2018. The new loans suggest the government is too complacent about rapidly increasing debt risks, Gregory Smith, fixed-income analyst at Renaissance Capital in London, said by email Thursday. “Last year, the government pledged it would be canceling loans and slowing down the accumulation of debt,” he said. “Adding more new loans is only going to aggravate what is already a dire situation.” IMF has warned Zambia is already at high risk of debt distress,348,255,8,2,14,60,9,117,2447434928640576,/story.php?story_fbid=2447434928640576&id=129987587052000

Kindly look into my complaint laid against DSTV/Multichoice Zambia with regards to thier services/content to its Zambian subscribers. I’m quite sure DSTV Zambian has 2 million + users, and GOTV another 2 million plus all paying cash for its DSTV services on a monthly basis. I’m a Compact plus subscriber on DSTV paying K530 monthly. Then there’s the Premuim for K850 & Compact for K350 per month! Not forgetting the GOTV subscribers who pay K90 per month. Im sure If you do the simple maths, you’ll get a surprisingly massive Kwacha amount per month paid to DStv, who must be making a million percentage profit every month. They obviously enjoy the Zambian business. But when corporations get too big, they seem to forget thier clients services. I'm 100% sure, if you had to carry out a simple survey in Zambia, there would be a bit more than 70% of Zambians that aren’t happy with the DStv services. Complaints are as follows: 1. Being a compact plus subscribers, we are paying for 12 non English speaking channels. 2. Then we pay for a weather channel that does not cover the Zambian weather at all 3. Then we pay for a live horse racing channel that is used for betting. Now tell me, who in Zambia is interested in this channel?? 4. Not forgetting the fact that we pay for repeats. We are subjected to continous reruns/repeats. I carried out my own brief channels survey. Each channel has no less than 2 repeats per day x 30 days. Wow, that's staggering. They must be making a massive save venture with the repeats!!! Again if we had to analyze each channel with the amount of repeats, definitely you will get a shock. Mind you these repeats can go on for months!!! In conclusion; a) Why do we have so many repeats? b) Why are we paying for 12 non English speaking channels? Example channel 147 is in Afrikaans/South African language . 99.1% of Zambians can't understand let alone speak Afrikaans. c) Then why have a weather channel that never covers our Zambian weather & we pay for this? d) Why do we have 1 channel solely dedicated to  "how to use the DStv decoder which runs 24/7 a week 365 days a year? e) Horse racing channels that have no relevance to its Zambian viewers?

Unfortunately, Lamasat International has still not paid the Bank.  This morning, Bailiffs from the Sheriff's Office swung into action to collect all assets of Lamasat in order to sale so that the recovery of the debt can start. By press time, the Bailiffs were still at Lamasat's head office and warehouse along Kafue Road collecting various assets, including office furniture. The Court of Appeal on 7th March, 2019 discharged an Injunction against the Receivership and entered Judgment on Admission against Lamasat for US$12,229,065.63 plus compound interest at 10% from 24th January, 2017 until the date of Judgment, plus continuing interest until full payment. "We initially appointed a Receiver, but they got an ex parte Injunction from the High Court against the Receiver. What necessitated today's action is a Writ of fifa," a source familiar with the development said. The business and management of Lamasat is now vested in the Receiver and Manager. The receiver Mwenya Andrew Mukupa is determined to recover what is owed. The status still remains as it were, Watchdog sources tell us. To recover all monies owed is the ultimate. Lamasat bosses from Lebanon have been making frantic efforts to seek State House intervention but have drawn a blank. In January this year, the Lusaka High Court also intervened when AtlasMara moved to recover its US$13 million loan debt from Lamasat International Ltd.,164,140,5,1,4,14,,81,2375235282527208,/story.php?story_fbid=2375235282527208&id=129987587052000

Korean multinational Daewoo Engineering and Construction which is constructing Kazungula Bridge shut down the site due to non payment of money by the Zambian government. Housing and Infrastructure Ministry Permanent Secretary Charles Mushota made the appeal today and claimed that the Zambian government has deposited K20 million Kwacha in the Zambia National Road Fund account for onward transmission to Daewoo but the money has not yet reflected. Two weeks ago, the watchdog revealed that construction workers at the bridge had gone on strike because they had not been paid their February salaries. The contractor could not afford to pay workers because Zambia owes Daewoo $14 million.

Sources close to state house revealed that President Lungu personally instructed that Chanda be left out of the campaign team after a recording was availed to the president last month in which Chanda was secretly claiming that he defeated both president Lungu and PF secretary general Davies Mwila to win the provincial chairmanship alleging that the president had wanted Mike Manda to be copperbelt chairman.   Chanda has conspicuously disappeared from most PF blogs including his own whatsapp group after it was announced that the Central committee had picked Joel Chibuye as the PF candidate for Roan. Chibuye was not among the applicants at constituency level and his name was only floated at the MCC meeting. There has been a power struggle between Chibuye popularly  known in Luanshya as Chibs and Nathan Chanda with both positioning themselves for the Roan seat. The central committee has further appointed Bowman Lusambo as campaign vice manager. Lusambo had taken to Facebook immediately after Chanda was declared copperbelt chairman and castigated him for reducing the campaigns to mere rhetoric about the black mountain.  Lusambo further cast aspersions on the quality of the leadership that came out of the provincial elections as lacking maturity. This was a direct attack on Chanda and Lusambo never received any reprimand from the party confirming suspicions that his attack on chanda had the blessing from the top PF leadership. Sources in Luanshya have revealed that Chanda has in the past few years made a lot of enemies in his quest for political power. "The mayor Nathan Chanda currently has a lot of enemies, he is not in good terms with Luanshya MP Steve Chungu, he has also differed with the DC, he differed with his deputy chair Kangombe after he openly supported Mike Manda", claimed the source.  A source from the central committee has further revealed that Chanda was sidelined from the Central committee meeting that settled for Chibuye as the parliamentary candidate despite Chanda himself being a member of the central committee.  11 candidates had applied to stand on the PF ticket including Chanda's elder brother Matthias Bwalya who withdrew at the last minute. Constituency officials in Luanshya had indicated that Chanda was backing Chejelani Maunda who he had picked to warm the seat for him as Chanda himself has ambitions to stand in 2021. But intelligence sources in Luanshya has said Chanda's popularity has diminished in Luanshya. Despite being reprimanded 3 years ago by the disciplinary committee of the PF, Chanda has continued to use the President's name unnecessarily and holding people at ransom in the party by claiming that he is very close to the president.,144,112,30,,,2,,71,2352280278156042,/story.php?story_fbid=2352280278156042&id=129987587052000

I have made several follow ups through phone calls, emails and text messages to the claims manager but non of these have been responded to implying that they don't care about their clients.The only person who picks up my calls is the manager at Chipata office and all he tells me are stories that yield to nothing. I was fortunate to speak to the director individual life in the first week of February who got all my details including my contact number and that was the end.What it means is that for the past 8 months ZSICLIFE has been making profits out of my money and many others of which they will not pay us interest for the period they have been illegally using our money. If ZSICLIFE management has failed to perform to expectation, let them leave the office for others who can do their duties diligently.

Police officers in operations on monday night intercepted two Land Cruisers ladden with PF cadres who were armed.  Chipasha, who is officer commanding for Senanga, Nalolo and Sikongo together with Nalolo officer incharge a Nkhoma went to the police office in the night after they heard that a group identified as PF cadres from Lusaka had been arrested and put in cells. "Against the people who were working these two officers ordered the release of these criminals. Most officers are not happy with the way they are handling things," complained one officer in a group of others. Yesterday, PF provincial chairman Charles Mututwa was at the Central police negotiating for the release of the 15 pistols and 30 pangas that were confiscated by the police. The development has upset local police officers who are fearing for a backlash from the residents if there will be violence in the elections. On the 2nd of February, officers patrolling the town in the night apprehended 18 people in UPND regalia who were found with pistols and pangas. The group identified themselves as PF cadres at the police station and called senior PF party officials who confirmed their identity. Chipasha and Nkhoma ordered for their release in the night.

With the planting season over, many farmers who paid k400 contributions towards the E–Voucher programme have not received their inputs. Minister in the office of the Vice President Sylvia Chalikosa has claimed that the late card redeeming was because of lack of capacity by agro dealers to supply the farming inputs. Most agro dealers are facing challenges to supply farming inputs to farmers because government did not fund them but asked them to use their resources and be paid later by government. Chalikosa says government is engaging the Ministry of Finance to ensure that money is released and regretted that the farming season was coming to an end.  Chalikosa asked farmers and agro dealers to share ideas on the best way of implementing the E-voucher system that has continuously failed. The government has continued to praise itself for distributing fertilizer ‘on time’ in January 2019 yet they should have done that in September 2018.

The commission wants the police officers who killed the student to be arrested.  Here  are the salient points of the report👇 👉🏿The HRC heard that as the fire in October Hostel 2 Room 21 was being quenched by some students, some  police officers repeatedly tear gassed the students who were quenching the fire and also rescuing their colleagues that were trapped in the rooms, causing October Hostel 2 Room 3, to also catch fire.  👉🏿* October Hostel 2, Room 25, which was occupied by eight (8) female students, was heavily affected by flames and fumes from Room 21 which was on fire.  👉🏿Some of the eight  (8) female students escaped by climbing down through the window 👉🏿 👉🏿23 year old Everntyn Choongo, jumped from the room, which is on the third level of the building and  suffered multiple fractures, including a broken lower spine.   👉🏿👉🏿Another student, Trudie Kalimbwe, who was the last to leave room 25 alive, suffered burns on her hands and hair before escaping through the door.  👉🏿👉🏿👉🏿👉🏿Regrettably, Vespers Shimuzhila, could not escape and was found unconscious.  🤦‍♀️Almost all the witnesses interviewed wondered where the Police Service wanted the students to be or to run to other than into the UNZA Campus Premises and, in particular, their rooms where they were being teargassed from, resulting into some rooms being gutted by fire thereby causing loss of life, injuries and property  The Human Rights Commission’s Observations, Conclusions and Recommendations: 👉🏿👉🏿👉🏿That the late Vespers Shimuzhila died as a result of “suffocation due to carbon monoxide intoxication” as confirmed by the medical evidence through a post-mortem.  👉🏿👉🏿👉🏿👉🏿👉🏿👉🏿It is therefore beyond any reasonable doubt that Vespers Shimuzhila did not die from a natural cause.   👉🏿👉🏿Further, from all the evidence submitted by a wide range of witnesses during investigations, it can be concluded that the invasion of the UNZA Campus Premises and subsequent throwing of suspected hand grenades and firing of tear gas canisters into students rooms by the Zambia Police Service, caused the death of Vespers, the injury of other students as well as the loss of, and damage to University and Students’ Property.  👉🏿👉🏿The Commission considers the firing of tear gas canisters in students’ rooms extremely unprofessional, an act of excessive use of force which resulted into a grave violation of the right to life, destruction and loss of property and undermining the right to education of the affected students whose education materials and equipment were either lost or damaged during the police night operation.   👉🏿It is clear from the totality of the evidence obtained that the police acted in an extremely brutal manner depicting a combative warfare situation against unarmed students who at that time no longer posed any real danger or violence to the police officers or to any other member of the public or property. Therefore, to that extent, the police overnight aggressive operation at UNZA  from 4th to 5th October 2018 could not be deemed as “use of force to such extent as is reasonably justifiable in the circumstances,” which is provided for under Article 12 of the Constitution of Zambia.  👉🏿👉🏿👉🏿👉🏿👉🏿👉🏿Appropriate criminal charges should be preferred against all the police officers (including the senior police officers who were in-charge of the operation) for the ensuing loss of life, body injuries to several students and damage to property 👉🏿The State being the primary duty bearer of human rights with the trio obligation of respecting, protecting and fulfilling the rights of all people in Zambia should be held vicariously liable for the actions of the police officers who are its agents; 👉🏿👉🏿 The estate of the late Vespers Shimuzhila should consider instituting  legal proceedings against the State and its agents (police officers involved) for the arbitrary loss of her constitutionally guaranteed and birth right to life in order to secure adequate compensation; 👉🏿Those  who ordered the attack of students into their rooms are already known by the police. 🐱The HRC therefore calls upon the Zambia Police Command to own up and take responsibility over the death of Vespers Shimuzhila and injuries sustained by Everntyn Choongo,  Trudie Kalimbwe and others as well as for the loss of property; Here is the full report👇 THE HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION SUMMARY STATEMENT OF ITS INVESTIGATIONS FINDINGS ON THE 4th TO 5th OCTOBER 2018 UNIVERSITY OF ZAMBIA (UNZA) STUDENTS UNREST: ISSUED IN LUSAKA BY THE COMMISSION CHAIRPERSON, MR. MUDFORD Z. MWANDENGA, ON 29th JANUARY 2019 1.0 Introduction The Human Rights Commission (HRC) has completed its independent investigations into the Students protest and the Zambia Police Service operation at the University of Zambia (UNZA) Great East Road Campus which took place on 4th and 5th October 2018 during which a female student lost life while another suffered multiple bodily injuries and property was either damaged or lost. The detailed investigations report has been submitted to key stakeholders, who include relevant Government Ministries and Offices, UNZA Management, Police Public Complaints Commission, the Inspector General of Police and other affected or concerned parties for their information and/or action on the findings and recommendations made by the Commission. 2.0 Main Objectives of the Investigations The main objectives of the investigation by the HRC was to establish the following: (i) Whether there was a student unrest on the 4th and 5th October, 2018 at UNZA as alleged; (ii) Whether the death of Vespers Shimuzhila was in violation of the right to life as provided for under Article 12 of the Constitution of Zambia;  (iii) Whether the said student unrest resulted in the injuries to students and loss of property; (iv) The manner in which the unrest was handled by the Zambia Police Service;  (v) Whether the loss of life, injuries to students and loss of property was lawful or justifiable under the circumstances; and (vi) Who (if any) was responsible for the loss of life, injuries sustained by students and loss of property. 3.0 Investigations Methodology The HRC employed a combination of personal observation, scene visits and inspections, examination of relevant documents, personal as well as group interviews with witnesses in order to come up with its findings, conclusions and recommendations.  Those interviewed included, but not limited to, the students, the UNZA Security, UNZA Management, UNZA Lecturers and Researchers Union (UNZALARU), UNZA Clinic Management, University Teaching Hospital (UTH) Management as well as the Zambia Police Service. 4.0 Constitutional and Statutory Powers of the HRC The HRC is an autonomous National Human Rights Institution (NHRI) established under Article 230 (1) of the Constitution of Zambia (Amendment) Act No. 2 of 2016. The constitutional mandate of the HRC is to ensure that the Bill of Rights is upheld and protected.  Article 230 (3) further mandates the HRC to, inter alia- “ (a) investigate and report on the observance of rights and freedoms; and (b) take necessary steps to secure appropriate redress where rights and freedoms are violated….; The mandate and powers of the HRC are also stipulated under Section 9 of the HRC Act, Chapter 48 of the Laws of Zambia. Therefore, the investigation, conclusion and recommendations herein were made within the above stated constitutional and legislative framework. 5.0 Protection of the Right to Life The right to life is a fundamental human right enshrined in various international and regional human rights instruments such as under Article 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), Article 6 (1) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and under Article 4 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights. Further, the right to life is entrenched in the Bill of Rights under Article 12 of the Constitution of Zambia as follows: “12. (1) A person shall not be deprived of his [her] life intentionally except in protection of right to life, execution of the sentence of a court in respect of a criminal offence under the law in force in Zambia of which he [she] has been convicted”.  Clearly, the right to life is not absolute. There are circumstances under which its deprivation may not legally be deemed as a violation of human rights under Article 12 of the Constitution of Zambia such as when someone has been sentenced to death by the courts of law as stated above. Further, Article 12 (3) of the Constitution provides circumstances under which the right to life may be lawfully taken away.  It provides that “…a person shall not be regarded as having been deprived of his life in contravention of this Article if he dies as a result of the use of force to such extent as is reasonably justifiable in the circumstances of the case- (a) for the defence of any person from violence or for the defence of property; (b)  in order to effect a lawful arrest or to prevent the escape of a person lawfully detained; (c)  for the purpose of suppressing a riot, insurrection, mutiny or if he dies as a result of a lawful act of war; or (d)  in order to prevent the commission by that person of a criminal offence.”   It is extremely important to take note of the constitutionally prescribed derogations to the right to life to assess whether or not the death of Vespers Shimuzhila constituted a violation of human rights or not as prescribed under the Constitution. 6.0 Findings of the Investigation Some of the salient findings of the HRC investigations were the following: 1. That there was and still remains no proper channel of communication between the Bursaries Committee and the student populace especially on schedule of payment of allowances following the ban of the Student Union by the Hon. Minister of Higher Education, Hon. Prof. Nkandu Luo, MP.  2. That it was true that some students who were protesting the delayed payment of the balance of K2, 000 meal allowance marched to the Great East Road on 4th October 2018 and started throwing burning tyres on the road but were quickly sent back into campus by some vigilant police officers who had been alerted about the protest by the University of Zambia Security Officers. There was no motor vehicle or property reported to have been damaged as a result of the conduct of the protesting students; 3. After the protesting students had been repelled into the Campus, relative calm had returned, particularly after the Vice Chancellor, Professor Luke Evuta Mumba, had addressed the students at night and assured them that their allowances were going to be paid by 8th October 2018. The Government started paying students their balance of  meal allowances a day after the protest, on 5th October 2018. 4. The Police were seen driving into UNZA Premises around midnight on 4th October 2018 and officers were seen jumping off a Green Nissan Police Vehicle and two other Land Cruisers, one of them labelled, “Simon Mwansa Kapwepwe Police Station”. 5. According to witnesses, gunshots were heard in UNZA Campus and police officers were seen throwing suspected hand held-grenades and firing tear gas canisters into students’ rooms through windows. A total of six (6) students’ rooms where tear gas canisters were fired into were gutted by fire.  6. The HRC heard that as the fire in October Hostel 2 Room 21 was being quenched by some students, some  police officers repeatedly tear gassed the students who were quenching the fire and also rescuing their colleagues that were trapped in the rooms, causing October Hostel 2 Room 3, to also catch fire.  7. October Hostel 2, Room 25, which was occupied by eight (8) female students, was heavily affected by flames and fumes from Room 21 which was on fire. Some of the eight  (8) female students escaped by climbing down through the window while the 23 year old Everntyn Choongo, jumped from the room, which is on the third level of the building and  suffered multiple fractures, including a broken lower spine.  Another student, Trudie Kalimbwe, who was the last to leave room 25 alive, suffered burns on her hands and hair before escaping through the door. Regrettably, Vespers Shimuzhila, could not escape and was found unconscious by fellow students who braved the reported continued tear gassing. She was rushed to UNZA Clinic where she was pronounced as brought in dead and her body was transferred to Levy Mwanawasa Hospital before being transferred to UTH Mortuary. 8. During the morning of Friday 5th October 2018, after the police operation at UNZA, some students and UNZA security personnel went round the campus premises and rooms to assess the damage caused by the police operation during the previous night. A total of 26 spent canister cans, which included 23 long range spent canister cans and three (3) empty hand-held grenades, were found and collected. Spent canister cans were found in all the rooms that caught fire.  9. UNZA Clinical Medical Officers confirmed that a total of 23 students, 15 female and eight (8) male, were treated for varying degree injuries and for inhalation of tear gas during the police operation at UNZA. Of the 23 victims, nine (9) were treated for physical injuries while 14 were treated for inhalation of tear gas.  10. Medical Doctors interviewed and others who witnessed the post-mortem on the body of Vespers Shimuzhila informed the HRC that the Preliminary Report of the post-mortem indicated that Vespers Shimuzhila died of “suffocation due to carbon monoxide intoxication”.  According to medical experts, “carbon monoxide poisoning is caused by inhaling combustion fumes or smoke inhalation during a fire, particularly in an enclosed or partially closed place. Carbon monoxide replaces oxygen in the red cells and prevents it from reaching tissues and essential organs such as the heart, thereby causing unconsciousness or even death”. 11. Almost all the witnesses interviewed wondered where the Police Service wanted the students to be or to run to other than into the UNZA Campus Premises and, in particular, their rooms where they were being teargassed from, resulting into some rooms being gutted by fire thereby causing loss of life, injuries and property.  The Commission’s Observations, Conclusions and Recommendations By virtue of the powers vested in the HRC pursuant to Section 10 (2) (d) as read together with Section 13 (1) (b) of the HRC Act, and arising from the investigations findings, the following observations, conclusions and recommendations are hereby being made:   1. That the late Vespers Shimuzhila died as a result of “suffocation due to carbon monoxide intoxication” as confirmed by the medical evidence through a post-mortem. It is therefore beyond any reasonable doubt that Vespers Shimuzhila did not die from a natural cause.  Further, from all the evidence submitted by a wide range of witnesses during investigations, it can be concluded that the invasion of the UNZA Campus Premises and subsequent throwing of suspected hand grenades and firing of tear gas canisters into students rooms by the Zambia Police Service, caused the death of Vespers, the injury of other students as well as the loss of, and damage to University and Students’ Property. The Commission considers the firing of tear gas canisters in students’ rooms extremely unprofessional, an act of excessive use of force which resulted into a grave violation of the right to life, destruction and loss of property and undermining the right to education of the affected students whose education materials and equipment were either lost or damaged during the police night operation.   2. It is clear from the totality of the evidence obtained that the police acted in an extremely brutal manner depicting a combative warfare situation against unarmed students who at that time no longer posed any real danger or violence to the police officers or to any other member of the public or property. Therefore, to that extent, the police overnight aggressive operation at UNZA  from 4th to 5th October 2018 could not be deemed as “use of force to such extent as is reasonably justifiable in the circumstances,” which is provided for under Article 12 of the Constitution of Zambia.  3. The investigations findings provided reasonable grounds to believe that the death of Vespers Shimuzhila did not fall under any of the human rights derogations provided for under Article 12 (3) of the Constitution of Zambia and various regional and international human rights law. It is regrettable that the Zambia Police Service conduct in this case amounted to breach of their own constitutional mandate and obligation to protect life and property and to uphold the Bill of Rights. Therefore, appropriate criminal charges should be preferred against all the police officers (including the senior police officers who were in-charge of the operation) for the ensuing loss of life, body injuries to several students and damage to property;  4. The State being the primary duty bearer of human rights with the trio obligation of respecting, protecting and fulfilling the rights of all people in Zambia should be held vicariously liable for the actions of the police officers who are its agents; 5. Further, the estate of the late Vespers Shimuzhila should consider instituting  legal proceedings against the State and its agents (police officers involved) for the arbitrary loss of her constitutionally guaranteed and birth right to life in order to secure adequate compensation;  6. The Zambia Police Service is a disciplined member of the armed forces and officers work under strict orders or instructions, and in an organized and clear channel of command, with specific officers in charge of every operation. To that effect, those who ordered the attack of students into their rooms are already known by the police. The HRC therefore calls upon the Zambia Police Command to own up and take responsibility over the death of Vespers Shimuzhila and injuries sustained by Everntyn Choongo,  Trudie Kalimbwe and others as well as for the loss of property; 7. The Commission wishes to commend the Government of the Republic of Zambia for promptly evacuating Everntyn Choongo to South Africa for specialist treatment and for taking care of all medical and incidental costs.  The Government executed its obligation of facilitating access to medical care in this respect and must be commended for its responsiveness.  In this regard, the HRC recommends that the Government should continue paying all medical and other incidental expenses towards the treatment of Everntyn Choongo until her full recovery and rehabilitation. The State should further compensate Everntyn Choongo for the serious injuries she suffered including a fractured lower spine resulting in her paralysis. The state should also extend the compensation of medical and incidental expenses to other students who were injured during the UNZA Police operation. 8. On a balance of probability, all the six rooms that caught fire and other rooms that had window panes damaged as well as loss of various personal effects of students can be attributed to the actions of the Zambia Police Service. Therefore, the State should compensate all the students that lost various property during the UNZA Zambia Police Service operation from 4th to 5th October 2018. To this effect, UNZA management must compile a list or report on the lost and damaged students’ property during the stated police operation. Affected students are also at liberty to consider instituting legal action against the State individually or severally; 9. There should be an effective mechanism of resolving UNZA disturbances between the Zambia Police Service and UNZA management which must be mutually respected by both parties. Information gathered by the HRC was that the Zambia Police Service was advised to limit their operation to keeping vigil around UNZA Campus Premises to maintain law and order outside Campus but leave UNZA Security Officers to deal with internal security issues, until or unless advised otherwise depending on the situation. 10. Students should desist from engaging in behaviour that is disruptive to other members of the University Community as well as the general public. They should always seek to address their grievances in a more civil manner that respects the rights and freedoms of others. Although the HRC did not receive a submission relating to any damage to property or injury caused by students during the protest under review, students should be reminded that members of the public whose vehicles they damage or target to damage during protests are the ones paying tax to the national treasury from which their meal allowances are drawn or paid. Therefore, students violence against members of the public is  criminal, unreasonable and unjustifiable in a democratic and civilised society;   11.  The Government through the Ministry of Higher Education and the Bursaries Committee must be proactive in redressing students’ grievances relating to payment of allowances, which historically lead to disturbances. It is regrettable that it seems it has become a customary practice that the Government will always swiftly pay students their  allowances only after a protest; 12. The Minister of Higher Education should lift the ban on Students Union at all Higher Learning Institutions such as UNZA. The ban is not only a violation of the fundamental freedom of association guaranteed under Article 21 (1) of the Constitution but also a violation of Section 27 (1) of the Higher Education Act No. 4 of 2013 which provides that, “There shall be a students’ union in a higher education institution.”  The student unrest of 4th October, 2018 demonstrated that banning student unions is not an effective remedy to averting student unrest. To the contrary, it makes the management of students’ welfare difficult as it breaks the communication channel between the students, UNZA management  and the Government. In concluding, the HRC wishes to stress that the Government of the Republic of Zambia has an inescapable mandate and obligation to ensure that whenever human rights violations occur within its jurisdiction, appropriate remedies are provided to the victims and/or to their families and perpetrators of human rights violations are punished in accordance with the existing national and international human rights laws to which it is a State Party.,441,346,,2,,79,14,89,2288495044534566,/story.php?story_fbid=2288495044534566&id=129987587052000

Mr Manyando first served as the first Ngambela for Litunga Lubosi Imwiko in an acting capacity from 13th October 2000 to 16th October 2006. The installation took place at Lealui palace today and several other indunas are expected to be appointed in the coming days to fill up vacant positions. Mr. Mukela Manyando replaces Mr. Nyambe Mwenda who resigned as Ngambela late last year.  The appointment further consolidates speculation of a fallout between the Litunga and the Zambian government as Mr Manyando is viewed as a pro Barotseland self determination advocate having left the position in 2006 partly due to his position on the issue of self determination. .And the new Ngambela has been told that the Kingdom was under ‘attack’ from foreigners who are determined to destroy Barotseland and has further been urged to unite the Kingdom. The Litunga is also expected to tour all the districts of Barotseland in the coming months.,354,313,22,17,1,1,,110,2268712789846125,/ZambianWatchdog/photos/a.2268712256512845/2268712789846125

With a brand-new year, many people hope for new begins, renewed efforts and invigoration be it in their personal or business endeavours.  But for those seeking justice in the Zambia judiciary, it is darkest. The Zambian judiciary has never been held at such low esteem and viewed with so much scepticism and contempt by the public like right now.  Thanks to chief justice Irene Mambilima and her team at the Supreme Court, the judiciary today ranks at the very bottom of public respect. We have never witnessed such judicial corruption, abuse and dictatorship like we have witnessed under Mambilima. In the past, people sympathised with judges even when they made ridiculous judgments as everyone knew they were doing so under political interreference. But what we have seen under Mambilima is judicial corruption and dictatorship by judges for and on behalf of themselves. Under the guise of judicial independence, judges have amassed too much power which they are now abusing to mask corruption. It should come to an end. It has been ended it in other countries. Corrupt and insolent judges are even more dangerous than thieving politicians because judges deal with life and death every day.  We have in mind one of the biggest scandals of 2018 where Court of Appeal and Supreme Court judges were bribed by Stanbic bank to overturn a High Court judgement that required the Bank to compensate Savenda management Services for maliciously listing it as a bad debtor when in fact not. That case has seen some individuals flee into exile while others are in jail but has made judges stinking rich. The Savenda v Stanbic bank scandal has for the first time given the public a glimpse into the dirty deals and corruption going on in chambers. That case has given members of the public an idea of what type of monsters we have for judges and what they can do when called to account.  That case has left a permanent scar on the conscious of the judiciary which shall not be wished away or erased by jailing whistle blowers.   As everyone knows, the allegations of corruption in the way the judges of the Court of Appeal and Supreme Court handled the Savenda v Stanbic case have not been addressed. Towards the end of 2018, the country was treated to a dangerous circus of jailing activists and journalists using the most ridiculous charges. In their quest to hide their wrong doing, the Supreme Court judges were more than willing to set aside one of the most cherished and fundamental rules of justice that an accused person should be subjected to a fair trial. At an irreducible minimum, a fair trial must have an accused person, an impartial judge, an accuser (prosecutor) and a witness. These should be different persons. But not under Irene Mambilima. Under Mambilima and Mwanamwambwa, we saw Derick Sinjela standing as an accused person, his accusers were the Supreme court Judges, the prosecutors were the Supreme court judges, the witnesses were the same Supreme Court judges. Even Satan would disown such evil set up. The Devil himself can’t be associated with such injustice. And to think that Sinjela is in prison because of such a ‘court’ is sickening but somehow gives hope that the fight for justice must continue.  Like we have already said, the jailing of Sinjela and Gregory Chifire does not address the corruption in the judiciary. It raises them even higher. People want to know what has led to one of their journalists been imprisoned. What was he talking about that made the judges so angry that they could send him to jail using a kangaroo court. The judges have something to hide for sure. Otherwise why are they so determined to suffocate anyone who asks questions? Why are they so angry at simple questions? Why are they changing the law? Chifire simply reminded them that there are allegations of corruption in the judiciary. He did not assert corruption; he pointed at allegations of corruption and asked the Chief justice to investigate the allegations of corruption in the judiciary. Is that a reason to jail him for six years? It simply means that the judges are guilty. They know very well that if a serious probe is conducted, the dirty would come out. Not only in the Savenda v Stanbic cases but also in similar cases that were settled not on merit but on Dollars. Why are the judges against any hint of a probe into their conduct especially in this particular case?  The judges might have jailed Sinjela and Chifire and will probably jail Bishop Mambo, but that will not stop public perception that that there is corruption in the judiciary. In the present case of Savenda Management Services v Stanbic Bank, there is only one way to go. A tribunal must be set up as a matter of urgency. If judges are clean, they have nothing to fear. To say that a tribunal will inconvenience innocent people is not even an argument. It is a lame excuse. It’s like saying that no one should ever be arrested because innocent people will be inconvenienced. Tribunals, like trials, are set up to find out the truth. In this case, Judges should welcome and actually be in the forefront calling for one to clear their names for once and all, if they have nothing to hide. As long as judges continue opposing and resisting the setting up of a tribunal, members of the public will be in order to point accusing fingers of corruption at judges.  As things stand, the judges are on trial in the public court. They may pretend and hide behind judicial independence hogwash and contempt of court charges, buy they actually know what the people think.  Like one USA judge said, the judiciary is, in at least some measure, dependent on the public’s fundamental acceptance of its legitimacy. And when a large segment of the population believes that judges are not deciding cases according to the Rule of Law, much is at stake. This is true today in Zambia. Under Mambilima, very few people believe that judges decide cases according to the rule of law, or any law at all. It appears that judges decide cases according to the exchange rate compiled by Stanbic Bank.  https://www.zambiawatchdog.com/disgraced-judiciary-should-be-cleansed-as-part-of-new-begining/,54,51,1,1,,1,,10,2241510592566345,/story.php?story_fbid=2241510592566345&id=129987587052000

The asylum seekers were led by that country’s opposition leader Tendai Biti.  The UN  says returning an asylum seeker to a country where he/she is fleeing is a serious violation of international refugee law. The USA has already threatened to impose sanctions on Zambia and the Watchdog understands that EU countries might do the same. But the Zambian government has already said it does not regret sending the asylum seekers to their enemies. Zambian government spokeswoman Dora Siliya says Zambia does not keep criminals like Biti who are fleeing the law. Siliya said Zambia is a sovereign state and can’t be bullied by colonial powers.

Meanwhile, Njekwa writes 👇🏾 Dictators have one thing in common; fear and insecurity.  The fear is so great that they can run away from their own shadow. That said, some of us are not even surprised to what is happening to Moses Katumbi, he should continue being strong. Southern and Central Africa is infested with hypocritical dictators who hide in the name of sovereignty when committing these inhuman injustices. Here in Zambia we had a worst case scenario than that of Katumbi. They cooked up charges for an opposition leader. He was arrested and charged with a possible death sentence charge of treason. Thank God we live in a global village and sometimes when these dictators become extremely overzealous, their powers are temporarily or permanently curtailed depending on prevailing factors. Katumbi should thank God that while they are barring him entry in his country, he is able to enjoy air con and coffee from wherever he is. In the Zambian scenario it was worse that the opposition leader was thrown in a maximum prison and in an overcrowded filthy prison. Obviously, the evil motive was to expose him to infectious diseases like Tuberculosis and let him die a slow death. I further notice that Katumbi was accorded a huge Zambia police escort. As much as I want to commend the gesture but something tells me oooh wait! What about our own largest opposition leader? Many times he's been left exposed to those jealousy and misinformed criminals. I recall one sad incidence in Kitwe where he had to escape bullets through the roof of a building. For God's sake this man virtually influences the running of the country since he oversees a huge number of law makers, mayors and councillors. Accord him some respect and dignity because he deserves it. This region needs liberation and the first step should be disbanding SADC and AU of course by dictators who found a haven. They have proved to be teethless organisations who send election tourists to monitor elections. Some few weeks ago I was puzzled watching H/Commissioner Emmanuel Mwamba claim that SADC has been peaceful for a long time. Then I wondered what planet the man was coming from. So much injustices are committed by dictators in this region and you call that peaceful? I want to agree if the definition of 'peace' is the absence of war. Today, Zambia has so many political prisoners and yet they call it a land of the free. UPND has many of it's supporters in prison with trumped up charges and some later released on nolle and acquitals a clear sign of witch hunt and cramp down on divergent views. Our leaders in Barotseland Hon. Afumba Mombotwa, Sylvester Kalima and Likando Pelekelo are among many people who are suppressed and made to suffer for divergence and what they believe in. Zimbabwe just like Zambia witnessed the gunning down of innocent citizens by the military that swore to protect the people. Is that peace in Mr. Mwamba's head? Our regions should hold hands and liberate themselves from tyrants. The Arab spring was inspired by a people who said enough to oppression by a few individuals entrusted with power. I know most of us where born from cowards who flee from many wars but that should never be an excuse.

STANBIC BANK CASE AT A PRESS CONFERENCE HELD AT THE FOUR PILLARS LODGE, LUSAKA MONDAY 11TH JUNE 2018 LEADERS OF THE VARIOUS NGOS REPRESENTED, FRIENDS FROM THE PRESS, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, May I begin by thanking you all, especially you our colleagues from the media for honouring our invitation to attend this very important press conference.   We have called this press conference in view of the serious allegations that have been reported about the conduct of some Supreme Court Judges in the matter of Savenda Vs. Stanbic Bank Zambia. You will note our interest in this matter that as the National Empowerment Forum (NEF), we were created to among other things champion the empowerment of local enterprises. Our vision is to promote the empowerment of Zambian owned businesses that can generate wealth for the country and create the much needed employment opportunities for the youths. It is against this background that we have in this consortium, youths that are equally adding their voices. Today, our youths are unable to get employment opportunities because the country has basically exported these opportunities in the name of foreign investment. It is our duty as an organisation to defend and promote local entrepreneurs who are trying hard under very difficult conditions to contribute to the country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP).  As NEF, we have taken keen interest in the recent Supreme Court judgement involving one local enterprise. As you maybe aware the Supreme Court overturned a decision by the High Court that had ordered that Stanbic Bank pays Savenda K192.5 million. In September 2016, High Court Judge, Justin Chashi ordered Stanbic Bank to pay Savenda K192.5 million for loss of business and vital contracts after Stanbic wrongly and negligently reported Savenda to the Credit Reference Bureau for defaulting on instalments. Stanbic appealed the decision to the Court of Appeals which decided that the damage suffered by Savenda was only nominal.  In March 2018, three Supreme Court Judges, Nigel Mutuna, Michael Musonda and Evans Hamaundu dismissed the appeal by Savenda. The Judges did not only dismiss the appeal but also ordered Savenda to pay Stanbic costs for all expenses the bank incurred from the High Court to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court said Savenda did not suffer even nominal damages and that Stanbic did not breach any of its duties to Savenda. While we respect the Judgement of the Supreme Court, we are concerned about the recent reports suggesting impropriate against the Honourable men on the bench. As a consortium, we are deeply saddened at these media reports as they speak to the country’s justice system. It is in the interest of the Judges and indeed the judiciary to ensure that they come clean against these allegations that have been raised and are playing out in the public.   We do not want to delve into the substantive allegations; however we challenge the Chief Justice Madam IREEN MAMBILIMA to save the Judiciary from an impending embarrassment.   In view of the serious allegations that have been raised against some named Judges, we demand the following; 1. That President Edgar Lungu immediately suspends the named Judges to pave way for the setting up of a Tribunal to investigate the serious allegations 2. The Chief Justice to immediately constitute a Tribunal to probe the named judges without any further delay. Any imputation of impropriate, especially corruption has the potential to seriously undermine the credibility of the Judiciary. Zambians have reposed their faith and trust in the Courts to resolve any conflicts and differences, and thus must always be above board. It is only fair that the named Judges should be given the opportunity to defend themselves in the face of the allegations so that this very important arm of Government can maintain its integrity. We also appeal to the Judges themselves to do the right thing by stepping down to allow for a full investigation. The Judiciary cannot afford to bury its head in the sand against the damming allegations that have been made against the Judges. NEF and the consortium members will be writing to President Edgar Lungu to suspend the Judges in accordance with the Constitution so that a Tribunal is set up to probe the named Judges so that they are cleared of the allegations. As an organisation we will also be writing to the Chief Justice to set up a Tribunal. I thank you and God bless Zambia!

The Kitwe Black mountain slug is mostly copper and cobalt. The mountain is being stripped at an astonishing rate. Cobalt is selling at $90,000.00 per tonne while Copper is at $7,600.00 per tonne. UNSAFE MINING METHODS Barely 3 months after the government of Zambia granted permission to the Copperbelt "small-scale miners" popularly known as Jerabos, a group being controlled by Shawi Fawazi and State House Special Assistant for Politics, Kaizer Zulu,  to mine at the Nkana slag dump also known as Black Mountain, several houses in a nearby mine area called Nkana West have been destroyed. The houses were destroyed by the rocks that came from the blast which occurred due to explosives that were used to blast a wall which was blocking an area that was intended for mining.  Zambian Watchdog exclusive The Jerabos had hired what appeared to be an unlicensed and poorly equipped a blasting company to speed up the strip ratios.  WHAT ARE THE FACES BEHIND THE PLUNDER? In 2015, through direct influence of State House , a judge ordered Nkana Alloy and Smelting Company (NASC) to surrender ‘Black Mountain’ to Shawki Fawaz, a documented criminal. He is a friend of President Lungu.  Black Mountain is a copper slag dump located in Wusakile township Kitwe. In April 2018, Minister Richard Musukwa  officially handed over the controversial Copper slug dumpsite famously known as Black Mountain in Kitwe to Chapamo Minerals Processing Company, a company formed by the Jerabos and Nkana Alloy, a Chinese Company. A BRIEF HISTORY Before privatisation, Nkana Slag Dump belonged to Nkana Mine of the Zambia Consolidated Copper Mine (ZCCM) Limited.  It was a licensed dump where slag from the Nkana smelter was being dumped until it reached its maximum design limit in the 1990s.  At privatisation in 1998, Nkana  Slag Dump area was hived off from the Nkana Mine rights and awarded to Chambeshi Metals Plc who had a plant in Chambeshi that could treat the slag materials and recover some of the copper and cobalt contained in it.  In the same year, Chambeshi Metals was granted a large scale mining license over the same area.  The company worked the dump from early 2000 to 2010,  when operations were suspended due to the slump in commodity prices and the global economic  crisis that not only Zambia, but the entire world faced.  On 27th December, 2012, Chambeshi Metals Plc applied to the ministry to transfer the licence over the Nkana Slag Dump to a newly formed company called Nkana Alloy and Smelting Company Limited.  Nkana Alloy and Smelting Company Limited acquired the  license over the dump through a transfer from Chambeshi Metals PLC on 23rd April, 2013, at a  total cost of K19,320,000.  At the time of the transfer, the shares in Nkana Alloy and Smelting Company Limited were Eurasia Natural Resources Corporation (ENRC) (British Virginia Island (BVI) Limited at 90 per cent and ZCCM-IH at 10 per cent.  ENRC (BVI) is the majority shareholder in Chambeshi Metals Plc with 90 per cent while ZCCM-IH holds 10 per cent of the shares. Immediately after the transfer, before Nkana Alloy and Smelting Company Limited could move on site, Chambeshi Metals withdrew the security personnel who were guarding the dump. This created room for illegal miners in the form of youth groups who immediately invaded the dump and started mining illegally.  The Ministry of Mines and Minerals Development later engaged the Zambia Police Services who drove away the illegal miners and provided security at the dump round the clock. A few weeks later, a company called Lunga Mineral Resources and Exploration Limited acquired a mineral processing license over an area within Kitwe District whose coordinates overlapped on the ground with the license held by Nkana Alloy and Smelting  Company Limited. Zambia Watchdog exclusive  Lunga Mineral Resources and Exploration Limited quickly sought a court order to protect their rights over the Black Mountain. The court order was granted to Lunga Mineral Resources and Exploration Limited and an injunction was served on Nkana Alloy and Smelting Company Limited which kept Nkana Alloy and Smelting Company Limited from operating the dump until 2013.  Lunga Mineral Resources and Exploration Limited then moved on site and started mining and security by Zambia Police was removed because there was a court order to  that effect.  The matter was in court from 2013 until early 2016, when the interim injunction was discharged and the court ruled in favour of Nkana Alloy and Smelting Company Limited as the  rightful owner of the slag dump.  Following this ruling, the Ministry of Mines and Minerals Development requested the Ministry of Home Affairs to again provide security at the dump and allow the legitimate owners of the dump, Nkana Alloy and Smelting Company Limited, to resume their mining and processing operations.

The youths have also chased officers with a Toyota Landcruiser from the Zambia National Service (ZNS) that provided armed escort to the controversial contraband. The youths hold the view that the export is illegal as government effected a ban on the cutting, sawing, sale and export of the valuable timber. In a video released the youths can be seen at the yard where the impounded trucks are and have vowed not leave until someone gives them answers.  They also state that they have confiscated all documents related to the contraband. PF Youths are known to take matters and the law in their own hands; in allocation of illegal plots and collection of Market and bus station levies, but this is the first time they have defied both the Police, and the military wing; the Zambia National Service, overpowered them and impounded the trucks. The transporter of the contraband is said to be State House Special Assistant for Politics, Kaizer Zulu. On Friday the youths mobilized themselves and intercepted eleven (11)trucks carrying Mukula logs for export. The youths found at the scene in Chilanga accused State House Special Assistant for Politics, Kaizer Zulu as being behind what they termed “illegal export of Mukula trees.” The Youths in a convoy of cars mounted their own roadblock at Shimabala toll plaza and confiscated keys for some of the vehicles. The stand-off continued for hours and one of the escort Driver reported to Chilanga Police  that the youths stole from him $22.000.00 for fuel and allowances for drivers and the trucks. They later forced the trucks to be parked at Chilanga Police Station. Although the trucks were escorted by officers from Zambia National Service(ZNS) and what was believed to be a State house vehicle, the PF Youths confiscated the keys and threatened to burn the trucks. The export is allegedly being done under the auspices of ZAFFICO. Early this year, Minister of Lands and Natural Resources, Jean Kapata banned the cutting-down and sell off any hardwood in Zambia that included the famous Mukula tree, Zambezi tic, and Rosewood trees. But she announced that government through the Zambia Forestry and Forest Industries Corporation Limited(ZAFFICO) would auction and sell off seized Mukula. And ZAMBIA National Association of Sawmillers has expressed concern that the government, through ZAFFICO, is selling Mukula timber at ridiculously low prices and has asked finance minister Felix Mutati to track the money and make the process more transparent.,576,523,31,12,5,3,2,295,1747247978659278,/story.php?story_fbid=1747247978659278&id=129987587052000

Eastern Chiefs, through senior chief Nzamane describes the whole plan to ban UPND and Tongas in that province as stupid adding that Edwin Sakala he, himself is a tribalist. The Chief says UPND has people from Northern and Eastern provinces and wondered how the ZDDM leader would begin advocating for its banning including Tongas in Eastern province. He says no Chief will allow such a move as Zambia is a unitary state. Audio there👆 The senior Chief also says Sakala should take his stupidity to his chiefdom of origin adding that even there Chief Misholo will not allow such nonsense of fighting Tongas and banning UPND. Senior chief Nzamane also says Sakala must go back to school and learn political science because at the moment just like Lungu and Daily Nation Newspaper owner Richard Sakala he has lost brains. Edgar Lungu using Richard Sakala who is owner of Daily Nation Newspaper and his brother Edwin Sakala have launched a tribal and civil war against the Tonga people of southern province but resident in Eastern province. The trio have since started planning to also deregister UPND and kill anyone supporting it in Eastern province. Lungu wanted to use this idiot called Sakala to begin the tribal and civil war by telling Chiefs from Eastern province to chase all Tongas there but according to the audio we have received, the Chiefs through senior chief Nzamane have blasted Lungu, Richard Sakala and Edwin Sakala over their stupid tribal war.

Mr Liswaniso says UPND will not succumb to claims and threats from the PF Lusaka province Youth leader Kennedy Kamba who yesterday ordered the police not to allow the party hold a rally.

Mr Liswaniso adds that party President Hakainde Hichilema and his Vice Geoffrey Bwalya Mwamba enjoy their constitutional rights such as freedom of assembly and association and that the two will go ahead and address the citizens on various issues affecting the nation during the rally. Meanwhile, the UPND National Youth Spokesperson has wondered why Police would get instructions from the PF cadres and go ahead to cancel a rally that is within the confines of the law. While maintaining that the party will go ahead with their planned rally, Mr Liswaniso has expressed disappointment with the Lusaka province police commissioner Nelson Phiri over his stance that UPND must not hold a rally which is their right. The UPND last week notified the police in Lusaka that they will hold a rally in Kanyama on 2nd April, 2017 but PF Lusaka province Youth Chairperson Kennedy Kamba yesterday warned the Police not to allow them and further issued violence threatening remarks stating that if UPND will go ahead, confusion orchestrated by the PF Youths will erupt.

Richard Mumba has been paid by State House to petition the constitutional court to declare 52 UPND seats vacant for refusing to recognise Edgar Lungu as president until the presidential petition is heard.  It is very easy for UPND lawyers to turn this case into a presidential petition, unless, the MPs won’t be given a chance to explain why they are refusing to be addressed by Edgar Lungu. Otherwise, MPs will tell the court that they do not recognise Lungu as president because they are convinced that it was Hakainde Hichilema who won the lections. The court will have no choice but to ask the MPs to produce evidence that Lungu rigged the elections.  So the dull PF has once more scored against itself.  By way he this crap called Richard Mumba iand his bush lawyer Malipenga are not new to this game.   Readers will recall that this is the same chap together with another mental patient Wright Musoma who were funded by Lungu to try and avoid the 2016 elections.  A few months before the elections  Richard Mumba and Wright Musoma sought a court order to stop the Electoral Commission of Zambia-ECZ from conducting the 2016 Presidential Elections.  The two through their quack lawyer Malipenga ‘argued’ that President Edgar Lungu should serve a full term of five years before another Presidential election.   Mumba of Chibombo District and Musoma of Lusaka said that article 35 Sub-article one of the Zambian Constitution states that every President shall hold office for a period of five years.   The two had claimed that  Lungu’s tenure would expire on 20th January 2020.

A proposal by Zambian football authorities to ban discrimination against gays and lesbians has kicked off a dispute over homosexuality, which is illegal in the country and widely seen as immoral.  The new draft constitution of the Football Association of Zambia (FAZ) contains a clause banning discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation, in line with regulations from world governing body FIFA.  But Zambian church leaders and senior football figures have attacked the proposal as undermining the country's devout Christian beliefs, which are protected by the national constitution.  Zambia does not implicitly ban homosexual sex, but it outlaws "carnal knowledge of any person against the order of nature".  "Zambia is a Christian nation and any instructions from FIFA which will conflict with Christianity are not welcome," former FAZ executive committee member Masha Chilemena told AFP.  "The FAZ cannot go against what is stipulated in the law of the land.  "If FIFA is to impose sanctions on Zambia, we will play in the local league."  International Federation of Christian Churches (IFCC) president Simon Chihana told AFP that if FAZ agreed to a clause banning discrimination against gays it would be "inviting the wrath of God".  "We are a blessed nation and we cannot allow an individual or institution to bring the happenings of Sodom and Gomorrah here," he said.  Illegal in much of Africa   Zambian President Edgar Lungu has spoken out strongly against gay rights, despite pressure from donor countries that provide essential aid to the country.  "Those advocating gay rights should go to hell... That issue is foreign to this country," he said after the arrest of two Zambian gay men in 2013.  The two men, who faced 14 years in prison if convicted, were acquitted the following year after more than a year in jail.  Amnesty International said the accused were subjected to forcible anal examinations by government doctors seeking evidence of sexual activity.  Homosexuality is punishable by the death penalty in Mauritania, Sudan and some parts of Nigeria and Somalia, and is also illegal in 30 other African countries.  FAZ general secretary Ponga Liwewe said that the association would ensure its new constitution was not against Zambian law, stressing that the document was still at its draft stage.  "When it is finalised, it will reflect the laws of the country and the law of football so that there will be no conflict between the two," Liwewe told AFP.  with the Engender Rights Centre for Justice group accusing evangelical churches of waging an anti-gay crusade.  "It is overzealous people, mostly Pentecostal movements, that are misleading the government and the masses," said ERCJ project coordinator Paul Kasonkomona, who was arrested and acquitted four years ago after he appeared on television calling for homosexual relationships to be decriminalised.  "The constitution says the rights of all should be respected, so let the rights of the minority be respected," he said.  "I don't think FAZ should feel that they are doing something wrong, they are not asking people to have sex. It's not a sin to be gay."

According to the Law, Lungu should have stepped aside this afternoon immediately the petition was filed in the constitutional court.  But instead, Lungu' spokesperson Amos Chanda has issued a statement that Lungu will be sworn in on Tuesday. 'Incumbent  President His Excellency Mr Edgar Chagwa Lungu of the Republic of Zambia, who is also President-elect will abide by provisions of the Constitution with regards to his inauguration following his declaration as winner of the August 11 general election,' Chanda said.  The refusal by Lungu to step aside shows that he will refuse to accept the judgment of the court unless it favours him.  Chanda said this in the same statement he was struggling to refute the statement issued earlier to the effect that acting president Patrick Matibini would address the nation this evening .  The argument that Lungu will abide by the law is not new. When parliament was dissolved, many stakeholders including LAZ advised him that ministers  could not continue in office. But Lungu argued that the law was on his side. Listen to his chibwibwi in this video on how he tried to explain his understanding of the law.

According to the results that ECZ announced for Lundazi Constituency Edgar Lungu got 29, 979 and Hakainde Hichilema polled  4, 975 that is 34, 954 for these two only minus results for other candidates. Yet the total number of valid votes cast is 29, 741. This is what ECZ chairperson Esau Chulu announced and you can listen to him in the attached video. He actually repeated the figures as he was reading on the documents. These are the results that made Edgar Lungu win. These are the 'official' results. In shame, ECZ has changed the numbers on their website and now PF has 21, 979 and UPND still has 4,975. 8000 votes have been removed from PF's total for Lundazi constituency.  Lungu alone got more votes than the valid number of votes. Really Esau Chulu, don't you have any intergrity remaining in you at all? Now listen  and watch disgraced former judge Esau Chulu in this video as he was announcing results to the world. The ECZ can try to change figures on the website but such videos are there for each constituency and will be availed in court as evidence to show discrepancies.  These are 8, 000 iflated votes already just for one constituency. There are disputed  votes from places such as Chingola, Mandevu and elsewhere. According to ECZ, Lungu went over the 50+1 threshold by 13 000 votes only. Now if 8000 has been removed from Lundazi alone, it means he is remaining with 5, 000 above the Threshold.

ObjectId("5e0ca44f4c36d57ff9611dcc"),Zambian Watchdog,,2016-06-14 08:18:40,HH: WE WILL START MANUFACTURING IMMEDIATELLY WE TAKE UP OFFICE Let us share that plan with you here today. We plan to start with job creation and employment. From the first day in office, our Government will help Zambian companies to create jobs, by ensuring we start manufacturing most of the things we import. Isn’t it an embarrassment that we are importing toothpicks? Are you telling me we can fail to make toothpicks? We will promote investment, trade and economic growth, diversifying the economy and investing in under-developed sectors with huge potential for job and wealth creation such as tourism. Point Two will be an attack on poverty and inequality, with a strong focus on youth and women.  On day one we will start addressing youth and women empowerment. The women folk present here today, can’t you sow uniforms. So why can’t Government give you contracts to supply uniforms in Government schools? Youths are found making furniture at Nakadoli market. Why is Government importing furniture for their offices and not buying furniture from Nakadoli market? This is what we mean by empowering women and the youth when you give us a vote.  Point Three will be investing in our people through education. There is no nation in this world that has advanced without a population that has the right skills. The youths that will be making chairs and desks for Government schools will need education before they get skills to start making desks. Our women who will be supplying uniforms to Government schools need education first before they can learn knitting and tailoring. This is why we are saying education for all is a must.  The waste we shall save from ending corruption in procurement of Government goods and services, by-elections and other areas will be invested in education. Now listen carefully here. In Zambia building a road costs 2 million dollars per kilometer, while in South Africa its 400,000 dollars. This means the money we pay for one kilometer, you can do 5 kilometers in South Africa. Why are our roads expensive? It’s because of corruption. Point Four is to electrify Zambia. The PF has failed to run the power sector resulting in load-shedding, limited and unreliable access and high costs of production. How are businesses supposed to operate under such conditions? Our plan is very simple, we are discussing with the private sector to build power stations from renewables.  What do I mean colleagues? Zesco is broke that they cannot build new power stations, we will talk to our friends in the private sector to build power stations, and the power produced will be sold to ZESCO, that is how we will end load shedding.  Point Five will improve competitiveness so that our local businesses can grow and create jobs, and new ones can start up. We will tackle areas such as heavy regulation, the high costs of transport and trade, access to finance and power supply.  Point Six will focus on aggressively cutting Government waste. We are not going to have 71 ministers in our Government the way our friends did. We are going to reduce on the number of ministers and review their conditions of service. A minister gets 800 liters of fuel per month, that is about 500,000 kwacha for the entire cabinet. By the end of the 5 years of PF we will have spent over 29 billion old currency on fuel for ministers. This does not include the free phones, cars, housing and many other things we provide to them. We cannot continue making a few people rich at the expense of 14 million Zambians.  Point Seven will develop our agriculture sector. Our job once you put us in power is to reduce the price of mealie meal. How will we do this? We will increase farmer support in both input provision and reduce the unit cost of production. In this country a farmer produces about 40 bags of maize per hectare when it is possible to produce 100 bags with the same inputs. What farmers need is a robust extension service system so that they can produce more by improving their management of fields. Once this happens then the price of a 50kg bag of maize will come down and with it mealie meal. We will also help farmers diversify their crop to produce other foods and grow produce for neighbouring countries.  Point Eight will end the flip-flops and policy inconsistencies that are costing people jobs. In this place over 10,000 miners and their affiliates lost employment. And the PF Government looked on as our people were losing jobs. From the time the PF took over they have changed mining tax policy three times, scaring investors away. What we are doing immediately you give us the instruments of power is to instill confidence in the economy. As a responsible Government we will rather lose a bit of mineral royalty than see you lose your wages and your livelihood.  Point Nine, building a healthy nation, cannot be compromised on. Colleagues, people are going to hospitals that have no medicines and doctors. We have a shortage of over 13,000 nurses and yet we have thousands of young people looking for jobs – another PF miscalculation. Meanwhile, the high maternal mortality rate remains a stain on the conscience of our nation. Immediately we take office we are reforming procurement of medicines in hospitals. The money we will save from a reduced cabinet and corruption will be used to hire nurses, doctors and buy medicines. We have already spoken to people that are willing to come and set up mini water plants in places like Chamboli so that you people can have access to piped water.  Point Ten is Good Governance. Zambians under PF are living in fear. If you say something against the Government or the President, then you are threatened with arrest. Police are being misused by the PF. People have to apply for permits to have church meetings. We are taking over Government to ensure that Zambians can enjoy their rights. We will immediately repeal the Public Order Act. We are also going to embark on reforming the Anti Corruption Commission and the Drug Enforcement Commission (DEC) to make them independent bodies to pursue corrupt elements. There will be no sacred cows in a UPND-led Government. We need to fight corruption to the bitter end, it has made us poor and I am telling you now, anyone who is corrupt will face the law. Corruption is a cancer that needs to be aggressively tackled.,235,230,,4,1,,,66,1176503822400366,/story.php?story_fbid=1176503822400366&id=129987587052000

Siliya was yesterday in Eastern province preaching, and spreading hatred against Tongas. With nothing to tell the people of Katete, this is all Siliya had to say: (click on Siliya's s image to listen to the recording) 1. When choosing a leader we have to first check if that leader is humble; does this person give us water and does he joke and laugh with people? 2- We have to find out if this leader has worked in government before, does he have experience in government, because government is not like a ka personal business of selling cattle and you think you can also take care of people, no. 3- When choosing a leader you should ensure that........(Zambia has many tribes and people have different character) don’t choose one with a short temper (small heart) and facial expression as if he has smelled something bad and does not even want to joke with people, wont that type of a leader arrest the entire nation? 4- Choose a person who humbles himself and fears God. 5- We want a president who brings all tribes together not just saying because I come from Eastern Province then you all follow me because I am your relative, no but one who brings all tribes together. This is a PF meeting and we are and we are here to point at the UPND, Iam not here to insult but a normal person cannot vote for the UPND. In the history of Zambian elections Eastern Province supported Chiluba from Luapula, Sata and Rupiah Banda and now we are saying support Edgar Lungu. The Lozis supported Chiluba, Kaunda, Mwanawasa, Rupiah and even Sata and Lungu got some votes from the Lozis. In North Western Province the Kalunda, Luvale and Kaondes have in the past supported other people. MMD under Rupiah was strong among Kaondes, Luvales and Kalundas and North Western also supported Mwanawasa and Chiluba from Luapula. The Lambas in Copperbelt, Lenjes and Lalas all supported other tribes. Now one province does not want to support others, which Province is that? Its Southern Province. Now listen, we know that Southern Province has Tongas and Ilas and many intelligent people who want their children to be in government at one time and they are ready to support other tribes but when they try to use their intelligence and support other tribes their leaders in UPND beat them, chase them from villages and burn their property for supporting other tribes. Now if you don’t support other tribes which tribe will support you? That is why UPND has lost every election, can’t you see? All elections UPND loses and now they come here in Katete (and you are lucky you have already supported other tribes in the past) So now all Zambians have said lets support one from the Eastern Province , its Zambians and other tribes who have said so especially Bembas who said they have given us Lungu to rule. UPND refused to support Rupiah and now God has given us another person from the East. Can the UPND now come here and tell us that we support them instead of Lungu as if we have no brains?

Pilato in Adele's tone, says it’s unfortunate that minister of Higher Education Michael  Kaingu has shut UNZA and CBU over allowances when his and cabinet ministers’ children are all abroad attending expensive schools overseas using tax payers’ money. The hot song below is currently making turns on radio and social media. On his facebook, Pilato had this to say:  NEW SONG ALERT Because I believe in the future of our great country, I also believe in educating our youth. The closure of CBU and UNZA was very unfortunate. While the minister and our president feel justified for doing so I feel we are just delaying our own progress as a country. Every well meaning Zambian should demand for the reopening of our two universities for the sake of our future. While it is true that you are punishing the students, it is also true that you are postponing the empowerment of our so many youths.

The bill is aimed at amending the current Constitution of Zambia.  Among the major changes the new constitution will have is that the Vice President of Zambia will be elected together with the president under the so-called ‘running mate’ clause.  For a person to win the presidency he or she would be required to obtain more than 50 per cent of valid votes cast.  In addition to elected MPs, the new constitution will also provide for 94 MPS who will not be directly elected by Zambians but ‘suggested’ by political parties but chosen by the Electoral Commission of Zambia. post system;  ‘ (b) ninety-four members selected from party lists submitted to the Electoral Commission by political parties contesting the elections, in accordance with Article 69, 10 and allocated in accordance with clause(3) below;  ‘ (3) The number of seats to be allocated to a political party, for purposes of clause (2) (b), shall be calculated by multiplying the figure one hundred by the percentage of the total aggregate vote, obtained by a political party in the National Assembly elections, using the largest remainder formula, as prescribed.,’ reads the suggested amendments to the constitution.  What this means is that, after the general elections, the ECZ will ask all political parties who would have won some parliamentary seats to send a list of individuals to be considered for nomination as MPs. From these lists, the ECZ will chose 94 people and make them MPs. The party that would have won more seats during elections will also be given the biggest number of bonus MPs. The most important point here is that the ECZ will have discretion to decide who to make MP. And since the ECZ is a government institution, the winning party will therefor decide who the 94 bonus MPs will be.  The new constitution will also make dual citizenship legal but individuals will dual citizenship shall not qualify to stand for election as president of Zambia.

Click on the video below to listen and share. SATIRE writer and singer Pilato, says Zambians must not be afraid to speak out when they see things go wrong in the PF government. The controversial singer has released a song titled A Lungu Anabwela, a parody of Nashil Pichen Kazembe’s 1970s hit A Phiri Anabwela. Featuring the voice of Michael Sata, the lyrics of A Lungu anabwela depict the predicament of a politician called Lungu, who emerges from Chawama compound with a suitcase full of Jameson whisky and ascends to power following the death of a leader. While maintaining the original music arrangement of Kazembe’s song, Pilato, whose real names are Chama Fimba, narrates how Lungu failed to develop Chawama. “A Lungu anaganiza sono nizayenda kuti, kateka wa PF, anamwalila kudala, a Lungu anaganiza sono nizabweza uti, RB na Dora ninabweza nikudala mama..,” reads part of the song. The song, which also questions President Edgar Lungu’s decision to retain MMD leaders whom the Zambian people voted out of power, has received a lot of attention and has drawn comments from individuals on social platforms such as WhatsApp and Facebook. In an interview, Pilato said he was inspired to compose the song to express his disappointment with wrong things going on in the country. “It’s more like a story of how things can change. Recall we voted for the PF because we didn’t like the management of Rupiah Banda and the MMD. But we now see that Rupiah Banda and the MMD are slowly taking over,” Pilato said.  “The truth is that most Zambians are very intelligent people. Maybe they love the country but they don’t care enough. Zambians would rather sit and watch things go wrong, an d say ‘oh’, and write a few comments on Facebook. But you need to get to a level where people need to stand up for what’s right.” Pilato also said if Zambians do not speak out, it will cost the country. “I feel I get moved when I see anything wrong and it’s done by our leaders and nobody says anything. It’s getting bad; people need to speak up. We need to speak out when things are going wrong. People should get to a point and realise this is the only country we have. It’s gonna cost us a lot,” he said. “I want to be an artiste now and in the future. I want to be the one that speaks for myself and the one that speaks for those that can’t speak.” The Copperbelt-based singer said he is not afraid of being pursued by police because he knows he is speaking the truth. “If you are saying the truth, you have nothing to fear. As long as you are not being malicious and just telling lies about people, you have nothing to fear. There is no room for fear, you can’t be that fearful. There is nothing as brave as truth. I don’t think there is any reason to be scared of anything.” Pilato further said he has received a lot of threats from people in the government and individuals from the ruling party. “They’ve always been after me; I don’t know how fast they will be on this one. I don’t even think there is need for that on this one. I have had calls and threats from the party in power. I don’t think that will change the way I look at things. I have had calls from people in government; I still receive calls and threats. People are sacred to speak; it’s not good enough,” said Pilat,795,792,1,1,,,1,405,960466274004123,/story.php?story_fbid=960466274004123&id=129987587052000

It also comments of matters that are sub-judice (in court) and consequently are in contempt of court.  Our findings from the Court documents (which are public) that the Ruling being referred to is not anything new.  The High Court to which they claim to have received justice from is the same Court whose orders they do not and did not respect at all, when delivered against them. On 28th March, 2015 Hon. Judge Mweemba granted Zambezi Portland Cement (ZPC) an injunction against the Ventriglias from interfering with the running of Zambezi Portland Cement (ZPC). In contumelious disregard of the injunction, the Ventriglias flanked by thugs with the assistance of Sakwiba Sikota S.C., stormed ZPC in masks and forcefully took over the running of the plant. Upon forcefully and illegally taking over ZPC, they then decided to go to the same Court whose Order they both ignored and flagrantly disobeyed and had the order set aside (ex-parte) without the other side being heard. At the time of discharging the injunction, contempt proceedings had already been authorized by the Hon.Judge to be commenced against the Ventriglias on account of their refusal to respect the Court’s Order.  We understand that the hearing of the injunction comes up this Friday, the 8th of May 2015 before Hon. Judge Mweemba for determination. It is therefore malicious and shameful for the Ventriglias to deliberately misinform the public that the case was dismissed. In fact, the case in question relates to alleged embezzlement and money laundering by the Ventriglias at ZPC to the tune of over $40 million US Dollars. There are also criminal charges hanging on their heads.  See more ,40,40,,,,,,14,948805188503565,/ZambianWatchdog/photos/a.574571859260235/948805188503565

In the 2013/14 marketing season FRA bought maize worth K52 million in Petauke out which it has paid K22 million. Petauke District Farmers’ Association chairman Wilson Phiri said the delayed payment to farmers by FRA will negatively affect yields in the 2014/15 farming season. Mr Phiri said in a phone interview on Tuesday that most farmers have not yet started planting for the 2014/2015 farming season because they do not have money to buy inputs. “FRA bought maize worth K52 million under the 2013/14 farming season in Petauke and has only paid K22 million and has a balance of K30 million to date. Currently, most farmers are in the Boma [the district headquarters] waiting to be paid instead of them being in the field. This will result in low production during the 2014/15 farming  season,” he said. DAILY MAIL,86,86,,,,,,148,882895981761153,/ZambianWatchdog/photos/a.574571859260235/882895981761153

Watchdog investigations have revealed that Mabvuto Phiri is the one who has been feeding the PF with lies that the TV station has sold its news to UPND. Mabvuto has been providing such lies to PF campaign manager Emmanuel Mwamba, who in turn has been circulating it through social media. The two meet at Mwamba’s house in the evenings.  In exchange for betraying his employer, Mabvuto and his wife have been promised jobs at the High Commission in Malawi if the PF retains power.  “Yes Emmanuel has promised Mabvuto that he and his wife will replace Henry Ngilanzi and his wife Chansa Kabwela as deputy high commissioner and first secretary respectively as long as he continues feeding the PF with information,’ a source has said.   Mabvuto’s wife Nkweto Phiri currently works for ZANIS in Choma.  Mabvuto Phiiri has had problems with Muvi TV before all evolving around his personal conduct but for some reason, the employer has been lenient on him.   Just recently, Mabvuto impregnated one very well known girl who had gone to Muvi TV on industrial attachment. He forced her to abort illegally using medical personnel at Levy Mwanawasa Hospital.

That’s the first time I had a conversation with him and we talked about just how brilliant he was and how I thought he had better chances of succeeding in places like SA. Since then we became acquaintances and we met and talked several times. The last time I met P-Jay was at my own studio at Vibrant Media where he and a lot other artists where recording the song Take Good Care. He was an amazing talent and his voice was unmatched on the local scene. I am convinced beyond reasonable doubt that P-Jay was one of the most if not the most featured Zambian artist. His angelic voice resonated with so many songs and made each and every song he featured on an instant hit. He was a talent that was cut out to make good music. When P-Jay passed on, I listened to the mother lament and I was struck with deep sorrow. She said her son though so popular left nothing behind, not a car not a house, nothing. These words where so heartbreaking to me. How can such a talented young man not afford a comfortable life? MUSIC PROMOTERS This country has some of the most talented artists in Africa but almost all of them are struggling. There are few and I mean very few exceptional cases. One of the major reasons for failure of artists to succeed and be able to make a livelihood out of this music they make is the lack of serious and professional music promoters. Music promotion is a professional marketing branch and requires people who are competent at the job. Most of what we see in this country is a situation where the artist is everything from a song writer, composer, singer, producer, manager, and promoter and later own their own boss. This culture has killed the industry. If we had professional music promoters, Names like P-Jay, JK, Kmillion, Roberto to mention but a few would have been great African household names. But because they have to do everything on their own, its 10 times the burden. We need trained music promoters who know the worth of an artist, that the artist is only as good as their last record. If and when we have professional music promoters, the lives of our artists will change exponentially.   ARTIST MANAGERS There is a huge difference between a music promoter and an artist manager. In Zambia the line is so blur you can’t see either. Artist managers are like Business Managers. They need to know their product, its worth, its weaknesses and a lot more. Without a proper artist manager, there is no branding of the artist, there is no value put on the artist hence can be bought by anyone simply by a cheap phone call. An artist who has no brand and no manager ends up performing in pubs and birthday parties. This is the common trend in Zambia. An artist who has no manger gets featuring on songs without been paid. This is what happened to P-Jay and it’s a lesson to those of you artists who remain alive today. Yes it’s a small industry and you need to help each other but remember that we all need to eat at the end of the day. Its not enough for someone to just buy you a 6 pack of beer just so they can feature you.  I own a studio so I know what am talking about. Everyone in Zambia loves free things. How do you expect the artist who you are not paying to buy expensive cars and later own build their own houses? I have been working with Shawn Kaystar Macky 2’s former manager for a long time and I keep saying the same thing to him and all the artists that he manages. This industry will only grow the day we all realize artists are not just humans, they are a product as far as am concerned and as such they need to be branded and marketed as such. P-Jay was not branded and marketed as such. He is not the only artist in Zambia there are several others like him. If the status quo is not addressed a lot more artists will continue to wallow in poverty while they pretend to be doing well and wanting to live an expensive life. We need serious and professional artist managers to change the industry for the best. The industry will not grow if we have no commodity to sale, the day we all start looking at artists as a product, that’s the day we ll embark on that journey as for now we can continue abusing these artists. Corporates will not hire you if you are not properly branded. Ask B’Flow he will tell you that you need to be a niche artist to succeed and thats what all Zambian artists need. I have been privileged to rub shoulders with some of the most popular artist managers in SA and Kenya and they have one golden rule which is that the artist is their workplace, their office and their livelihood. Without this attitude, we wont go anywhere. What kind of a manager will allow their artist to be featured without been paid? One of the artists from my studio wanted to feature Davido on a song and his manager asked to be paid 12,000 dollars for just a stanza on the track. Now this is how managers do for their product, they know its worth and hence they can put a price to it. In Zambia artists are contacted directly by whoever has a party and they can negotiate their own price sometimes which is paid in kind “booze”. How do you seriously hope to see artist live a dignified life? MUSIC PRODUCERS  and equipment, its about the popularity of a producer. Even if you operated from a bedroom and used only your computer and a sound card, you could still be a popular producer in Zambia. The point and the math is in how many artists you can record for free and almost free. Zambia artists are not willing to pay for a quality product. They are willing to stick their reputation just to have shoddy job done for them so they can have it on air the next morning. Sadly in Zambia people do not yet appreciate greatly produced and mixed music. Anything goes in Zambia and that’s why we are not putting the pressure on our producers to be more creative. All the songs are like produced by the same person with the same samples. Just hearing the intro beat you can even tell who the producer is even before they put their brand there. MUSIC STUDIOS What are called studios in this country are but a sham. I Have seen not more than 6 very low budget studios (that includes mine lol) which in Zambia are close to anything that looks like a studio. Buying studio equipment is very costly. I will give you an example. A mixer, a good one is about K10,000, Studio monitors (speakers) good ones are K 14,000, a good microphone is K2,500 a good music production PC or MAC is around K15,000, A vocal Compressor the cheapest professional one is K8,000. You need a few instruments like a keyboard which will cost not less than K12, 000 for a mid-road one, a guitar K3, 000 . I guess you have a picture from this list that music production equipment in Zambia is not cheap. I ordered an M-Audio Surface Controller from the USA and its about $2400 to get to Zambia and Ben has one you can ask how much he got his. What am saying is after spending so much on equipment then you have an artist who want you to produce music for him or her for free. It’s a messed up system that need serious attention or else we won’t go anywhere. For us to attract good artists and good business we need professional studios and a professional work environment. COPYRIGHT  I have been a student of copyright law and it saddens me to see how copyright is violated in Zamia. Most of the music in the adverts is not acknowledged as intellectual property and later on paid for by those who use it. Big TV and Radio stations use artistic works and performances with impunity. The current status of ZAMCOPS is a mess. I have been having conversation with the Manger the past couple of weeks because I think the royalties they collect do not in any way benefit the owners of artistic works. We need serious people to run our institutions who understand these things. Intruding a hologram might sound like a good idea to some people but not to me. This is a digital age, anyone who thinks they will fight piracy by putting a hologram on a CD are serious jokers and are wasting resources that can help the industry to grow. Hip Hop grew out of piracy. Am not trying to be controversial but I think we need to address real issues and not the results of our failures.  CONCLUSION My conclusion is that most Zambia artists just put up face, they are poor and struggling to make it. We need to invest in arts and do things in a more professional manner. As things stand a lot more artists are in the same position as my late friend P-Jay. We also need artist who are educated by their managers to invest in other aspects of business other than the arts.  I rest my case.,331,324,,1,,5,1,289,870174389699979,/ZambianWatchdog/photos/a.574571859260235/870174389699979

Mafikizolo is one of the most popular and talented Grammy award winning groups in Africa and last night was a disgrace to Zambia.  Organisers failed to meet the standards for the group to perform which ended in a disaster.  People were made to wait from 20 hours to 02 hours in the morning  just to see the duo perform.  ‘But the mics on stage weren't working. The music system didn't agree with them and it ended in a violet manner,’ said a fan who attended the ‘disaster.  The group was locked in a room and one of the organisers was harassed for refunds, which he failed to give.  Eventually some people decided to help themselves to the music equipment including those of Mafikizolos as there no police to control the situation. . ‘These organisers must be brought to book immediately for not only failing to meeting the standards of service delivery but for inconvenience the artists,’ a fan complained.

As a result, Hakainde Hichilema said, the people of Zambia are looking up to him to lead the country. Sata’s ruling Patriotic Front (PF) party has been embroiled in inter-party squabbles over who should be the presidential candidate. Two competing factions have chosen different candidates – Defense Minister Edgar Lungu and deputy commerce minister Miles Sampa. The opposition Movement for Multiparty Democracy (MMD) has also chosen two presidential candidates – former President Rupiah Banda and Nevers Mumba, the MMD’s current president. Hichilema said he’s not surprised by the current divisions within the ruling PF party. “I’m not surprised because the ruling party has always exhibited the traits of confusion and lack of order. In fact, they are the ones that have been perpetrating the break down in the rule of law. All of that was happening even before the late president passed on,” he said. Hichilema also criticized the opposition MMD party for its split leadership and said Zambians are gravitating toward the UPND because of the confusion within the two other parties. “We are basically already providing leadership from the opposition. We are running the country from the opposition. I think what is now expected is to formalize that through an election so that the country can be run by us directly,” Hichilema said. Hichilema said the UPND aims to reunite Zambians as a platform for an accelerated economic and social development. He said over 20 MMD members of parliament have already endorsed his candidacy for the presidency, and that he’s invited more to join and use the UPND as a platform for change. Zambia is Africa’s second largest copper producer, but Hichilema said all measures of economic performance have been negative recently, with the country seeing high levels of unemployment, high food prices, lack of clean drinking water, and few business opportunities. Hichilema said his main reason for seeking the presidency is to improve the economy. “Our main reason for seeking public office is to turn around the economy. We will focus on creating and improving the business and investment environment. Make it attractive, credible, predictable, and consistent. And once we do that, we will see basically the investment sector in Zambia, they will choose to stay; they will also do more than stay. They will reinvest,” Hichilema said.

And Kaseba, the widow of late president Michael Sata shocked elders when, using bin liners and bedsheets, she bundled President Sata's clothes, suits and shirts and threw them at the elders. See the photos below.  That was just after forcing a "Sambo lya Mfwa," the official meeting following someone’s death. According to people in the Sata family, the former first lady was supposed to be in-doors for a month mourning her husband and then go to the village to be cleansed.  But elders were shocked that just after foreign dignitaries who came to mourn the president left, she forced them to convene Sambo lya Mfwa and demanded to be cleansed that same day.   The elders from Mpika obliged and cleansed her. But before they could disperse, she ordered servants to pack Sata’s clothes in bedsheets and told his elders to take them to the village.  It appears Kaseba despised her husband so much that she could not even pack his clothes in suitcases but wrapped them in the these cheap materials as seen in the pictures.

This means Hichilema will not be arrested for the fake charge of contempt of court the PF government was trying to persecute him with. Meanwhile, Kitwe came to a standstill Tuesday morning as residents turned up to salute HH as he went to court. Scores of Kitwe residents followed Hichilema to the Kitwe High Court while singing solidarity songs and raising the UPND symbol. As Hichilema came out of court, some youths were seen kneeling down before him to tender their apologies. The youths were later identified as the group that was hired by PF three months ago to beat Hichilema when he appeared at a radio show in Ndola. In court, the judge decided that Hichilema had good reason for missing court session and accordingly discharged the warrant of arrest.  But the main charge of contempt of court will continue and has been adjourned to October 7, 2014.

This is in the case in which Justice minister Wynter Kabimba and OP boss Mwanamwange are pushing the judiciary to lock up Hichilema for missing a court hearing.

He talked about a lot of things but the main point of the article was that the UPND will not win the 2016 elections because their performance in the past has been poor and has been actually declining. He asserted that it would be a miracle for the UPND to win the polls in 2016. Muhabi Lungu admits that he was forced to write-off the UPND’s chances of winning because UPND leader Hakainde Hichilema referred to people re-joining MMD as mad. I do not know if HH said that, as the only source is Muhabi himself and maybe the Post newspaper. But I recall reading a few days before he wrote this diatribe, Muhabi warned people to be careful with what the Post newspaper publishes. He said people must verify whatever the Post writes before commenting. Hope he did verify himself. Somehow, I find it a bit curious that brother Muhabi was so worked out by this political language, which is commonly used in Zambia. Why is Muhabi personally offended by that alleged statement? Is it because Muhabi is the only person who has joined the MMD in the recent past or otherwise took up a senior position when others have been leaving? Well, Iam not aware of anyone who has joined or re-joined the MMD from the time that party lost power in 2011.   Muhabi defends his leaving a well paying job at the Zambia Developing Agency (ZDA) to join a party that everybody knew was losing elections by saying that ‘I for one belong to an organization because I believe in its values, principles and methods, even if it means that adhering to those values means sometimes losing’.   This is the same Muhabi who remained in UNIP after everybody had left. Now, UNIP and MMD believe in very different values. When MMD came on the scene and wrestled power from UNIP, Muhabi stuck to UNIP because he supposedly believed in UNIP principles. Now, Muhabi believes and will defend MMD methods and principles with his life?  Certainly it is desirable and admirable to believe in values and principles; but shouldn’t those values be consistent? And what values is Muhabi talking about in MMD? Was Muhabi’s ascendency to the MMD secretariat based on principles or ‘winning at all costs’? Does Muhabi believe in the physical methods the MMD used to hound out Richard Kachingwe? Does Muhabi approve of all the things the MMD has done from inception?  What we (me and my colleagues) think is that Muhabi is just one of those people who hate change. He is confortable and feels safe in what he is familiar with. He dreads the uncertainties change can bring.   It is Muhabi’s contention that the UPND is wrong to assert that they will win the next general elections. What does he want them to say, that they will definitely lose?  He provides some past statistics from some website and uses them as his justification that the UPND will lose; yet he is quick to say that results of past bye-lections are not indicators of would-be results of general elections.  His thinking or reasoning seems to be that you can only use results of presidential elections to determine future presidential elections. If that were the case, our own beloved Rupiah Banda would have won the 2011 elections since he won the 2008 elections and the MMD also won the elections before that.   To discount the relevance of bye-elections to general elections, Muhabi says ‘for example, the MMD won the Mpulungu by-election in October 2010 but subsequently lost it to PF less than a year later in 2011. The UPND won the Chilanga, Mufumbwe and Solwezi Central by-elections but subsequently lost all three to MMD in 2011’. Yet, Muhabi conveniently left the many bye-elections the PF won in this period.  He also decides not to mention that the election of the MMD MP for Solwezi Central was nullified because of malpractice and did not represent the will of the people. It represented the will of the MMD. The same was the case for Mufumbwe but Steven Masumba saw the nullification coming fast and ‘danced’ by resigning and joining PF where, using state resources and intimidation, he retained the seat. The results of Chilanga seat are still being contested in court.  On the Mpulungu bye-election of 2010, what Muhabi did not want to say is that the PF, then in opposition, only lost that seat with 85 votes and that the PF never conceded defeat.   PF candidate Freedom Sikazwe polled 4,419 votes against the winning MMD candidate Given Mung’omba who got 5003 votes. PF president Michael Sata accused the ruling MMD of producing about 500 votes from “imaginary” polling station in order to win Mpulungu. So when the PF won the Mpulungu seat a year later with a huge margin, there was to be no surprise. That bye-election actually showed that the people in Mpulungu wanted PF not MMD but due to malpractice, the MMD ‘won’ the seat.  So, the four examples given by Muhabi are dismissed with the contempt they deserve.  Need we remind Muhabi that during the general elections, the PF retained all the seats they scooped during the bye-elections leading to the general elections? If you cannot gauge the changing political mood using bye-elections, then we wonder what else you can use since Muhabi does not seem to provide an alternative. Given what has already been said about Muhabi’s political acumen and his history of sticking to losing parties, we do not think Muhabi is the best advisor for political moods and patterns. Is Muhabi telling us that the bye-election the MMD won in Eastern Province where the MMD still seems to have following are meaningless and that come 2016, those people will vote for another political entity? Muhabi does not seem to realize that voting patterns and trends change, no wonder his poor political judgments always.  For example, it was commonly said that people in Western province couldn’t vote for Michael Sata. But was that true in the 2011 elections?   Looking at his so-called demographic map, it is clear that Muhabi is saying, though he is afraid to do so plainly; that people of Luapula, Northern and possibly Eastern cannot vote for UPND. Brother Lungu is advised to steer away from tribal politics. He is too educated for that. Such are the values he should believe in.   According to Muhabi, no presidential candidate can win an election without out-rightly winning at least two of these five provinces he lists as Copperbelt, Lusaka, Northern, Eastern, and Southern. Implicit in this ‘prophesy’ is that any other candidate apart from the UPND candidate can with any two of these.  Yet, apart from outdated statistics, he provides no useful explanation as to why the UPND candidate cannot win, say Lusaka or Copperbelt or both. Everybody knows that the UPND has been making inroads in the Copperbelt and for the first time since that party was formed, they won a parliamentary and local government bye-election on the Copperbelt. This is actually the reason Muhabi is vehemently dismissing the relevance of bye-elections because they go against his heartily held views that the UPND cannot win any votes on the Copperbelt. He would rather stick to stale statistics when there are fresh ones.    UPND has won Lusaka votes before and can do that again with proper campaigns. So going by Muhabi’s own statistics, the UPND can actually win.   It will also be a good idea for Muhabi to stop speaking of other provinces such as Northwestern, Luapula and Western as though they add nothing to national voting. As MMD national secretary, he may one day find himself pleading for votes from the same provinces he despises.    If winning the presidential election was just by a candidate adding on top of what his party obtained in the previous polls as Muhabi seems to be saying, then RB would still be in State House. It is erroneous and fatally misleading to suggest that HH needs to move his percentage from 18 per cent he got in 2011 to get 40 per cent to win in 2016. In the first place, that 18 per cent will not be relevant for the 2016 elections. All candidates now have zero. In elections, you start afresh for each subsequent election. That is why Muhabi is wrong to think that the MMD will just top up from the percentage they got in 2011.   What happened in 2011 is gone. Bye-elections that are being held now have more relevance because they are based on the same issues that will be hot in 2016. Voters have tested the current government and will vote according to what has happened between 2011 and 2016. Unfulfilled promises, bad governance etc… It is hoped that Muhabi is not cheating Reverend Nevers Mumba that all the people who voted for MMD will also vote for the MMD again in 2016. There are a lot of factors why that won’t be the case. In 2011, the MMD was in power and some people just want to align themselves with the ruling party. The Munkombwe philosophy. The MMD had access to state funds and could reach areas the opposition could not. Unless, the PF tempers with the order of things, there will be a new register and many new first-time voters. In these five years, a lot of young people would have become eligible and if registered, they may not vote the way others voted in 2011. In these five years, people who voted in 2011 would have moved, died and others will not cast the vote for varying reasons.   But most important, the MMD has a new head. Those 2011 voters might have voted for Rupiah Banda and his men such as George Kunda and women not necessarily MMD. Now the MMD has to sell Dr Mumba and his team. There are no votes somewhere at the ECZ stored for Dr Mumba as inheritance from RB. If things were working like that, HH would have just topped up from what Mazoka left for him and won the elections. Unfortunately or fortunately, HH has had to build his own brand; and it has taken him almost ten years to be where he is now and see real chances of becoming president. Dr Mumba will have to go through the same process.   If losing previous elections is the main factor that determines who wins the next polls, then the MMD will never win elections because in 2011, contrary to what Muhabi is trying to portray, the biggest loser was the MMD. MMD was in power but lost that power. Is there any bigger loss to that?   The question Muhabi should be addressing is whether the MMD is selling Dr Mumba. Does Mumba has a team to market him or be marketed with him? Do people like Bowman Lusambo who seems to be the MMD vice-president add value to the team? Is MMD gaining or declining as we move towards 2016? For now, MMD seems confined to the Eastern province. If there any seat the MMD will win in the next parliamentary bye-elections, it will be in Eastern province and not anywhere else in the country. This is a fact and anyone who thinks otherwise is cheating himself. This is the current situation.   Muhabi Lungu asserts that ‘even if we were to give UPND the benefit of doubt that they have the capacity to reverse this trend in Lusaka for the 2016 elections, the upward trajectory of Mr. Hichilema would have to significantly surpass all his past performances. It will be a tall order for the UPND to reverse this trend and double their 2011 performance from 11% to 22% in Lusaka.’  Is this really impossible? What was Michael Sata’s performance in Western province in 2008 and 2006? Didn’t he triple those figures in 2011? Muhabi should not be afraid or think that tremendous achievements are impossible. It is only him who has that defect of failing to move mountains. Voters in a region can swing within a few days and talking about 30 or 50 per cent is nothing.  Instead he says he ‘did relatively well.’  The results of 2001 are here on the official ECZ website:   And the diagram below shows how Mazoka overwhelmingly won Lusaka. But Muhabi would rather say ‘did relatively well’ to justify his assertion that the victory was not stolen from Mazoka.  He would also rather avoid official ECZ diagrams and pick from some website because they tally with his agenda. The truth as is tabled on the ECZ website is that Mazoka won Lusaka overwhelmingly and in fact almost all the MPs in 2001 for Lusaka province were from UPND. Is this doing relatively well or excellent performance?  Mazoka also beat all the candidates in central province but Muhabi would rather say did relatively well because reality is against his agenda. Muhabi is advised to check the  speed at which he is  becoming a full fledged useful idiot for the PF,44,44,,,,,,78,793166074067478,/ZambianWatchdog/photos/a.574571859260235/793166074067478

During his visit to Washington, Vice President Guy Scott must be grilled on critical issues such as President Michael Sata’s health, the PF’s failure to deliver the draft constitution, and the widespread harassment of journalists and opposition MPs.”  Delegates to the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit should ask Dr. Scott why multiple judges have been fired and the independence of the judiciary violated just to help Post newspaper owner Fred M’membe and Director of Public Prosecutions Mutembo Nchito avoid having to pay a K14 billion debt to the Development Bank of Zambia, Amsterdam says. l organization Freedom House, Zambia received a “downward trend arrow” due to the ruling party’s ongoing repression and harassment of the political opposition, including through the increased use of the Public Order Act, hindering its ability to operate in general and to campaign in by-elections.  The United States government has a known record of supporting the PF despite its poor record on rights and democracy, dating back to their forceful demands for parallel vote tabulation in the 2011 elections. Most recently, the U.S. funded Zambian chapter of the Young African Leaders Initiatives (YALI) – a major Obama Administration project - was expelled from the Grand Coalition of NGOs, an umbrella group calling for immediate delivery of a new Constitution promised by the PF.  This came after YALI sided with the Zambian government, calling for the constitution to be delayed until 2017 – a plan that was immediately endorsed by the ruling party.  Meanwhile, the lack of governance in Zambia has led to severe mismanagement of the economy, rising inflation, a near collapse of the Kwacha and rapidly increasing food prices. The only response from the PF government has been to stir up tribal conflicts. “The U.S. administration must support unity and peace in Zambia, instead of endorsing the PF’s efforts to sow divisions and ethnic conflict,” said Amsterdam, pointing out Guy Scott’s own recent tribal slurs in an interview with the BBC, as well as Justice Minister Wynter Kabimba’s deeply divisive comments to ZNBC on Monday when he claimed that “educated” Zambians wanted to “hijack” the constitution.  “Many observers feel that Zambia is running on auto-pilot right now, as the president has made only a handful of appearances in recent months and hasn’t directly addressed the nation in a very long time,” said Amsterdam. “In this vacuum of leadership, it appears that Vice President Scott and Justice Minister Kabimba are once again defaulting to conflict and division as their language of power.”  “Washington has a responsibility to support the public safety of all Zambians and the stability of the nation – they must immediately stop enabling the abusive conduct of the PF,” said Amsterdam,113,113,,,,,,118,790274661023286,/ZambianWatchdog/photos/a.574571859260235/790274661023286

Family man and father of three, Qhubekani Dube, 44, of Pumula East suburb was arrested on January 12 charged with robbing Inter Africa Bureau De Change in Kazungula of $17,000 on December 31 last year.  His case has been set for trial at least four times but has failed to take off after the prosecutor, the robbery victim or both, failed to show up in court.  Hermis Transport Congo, the company he works for, sent evidence to Zambian authorities, collaborated by about 40 other truckers, to show that Dube was in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) at the time the crime was committed but the courts have seemingly ignored it.  Copies of pages from his passport also show he was in the DRC on December 31.  His children have since stopped going to school because they have no one to pay their fees.  Dube has written letters from prison to organisations that include various media houses in Zambia, international human rights organisations, embassies in both countries, Cross Border Truckers Association, stating his case and appealing for assistance.  Dube's mother, Gogo Lucy Dube, 73, shed tears as she narrated her son's ordeal to Chronicle.  "As you can see from the letters, he left Zambia for DRC on 12 December and was arrested on 12 January when he eventually returned. The Zambian police have all the evidence to show he is innocent but they don't want to release him," said Gogo Dube.  She said the family could not meet the demands for $2,000 or K10,000 from the prosecutor (name withheld).  "No one has that money. The children aren't going to school. We have no money to travel to Zambia every time they say the trial is on. We can hardly feed ourselves. I don't know which office I can approach to secure freedom for my innocent son," she said.  In a letter addressed to the Ministry of Home Affairs in Zimbabwe, Dube said he was innocent but was being held to ransom by unscrupulous court officials.  "Honourable Minister, when all this happened I was not in Zambia. I was in another country at work. My company has been writing letters and have provided the Zambian police with proof that I was indeed in Congo when all this happened," wrote Dube.  "The company has even engaged a lawyer for me but the lawyer has been working on behalf of the public prosecutor demanding K10,000 from my wife in Zimbabwe so that they can dispose of the case when they know I am innocent."  Fellow truckers who were with Dube in DRC when the crime was committed, said their friend was literally "rotting" in prison.  "They don't give them food. He relies on handouts from truck drivers who pass through Livingstone to feed him. Sometimes he goes for days without food when there is no truck traffic into Zambia," said a driver.  Gift Murapa, the managing director of Crystal Clearing Company in Victoria Falls, said what was happening to Dube was serious injustice.  "I think these people just want to wear him down by keeping him in prison until he pays. Mambo Moyo, a truck driver who had been with him in the DRC when the crime was committed in Zambia, tried to back Qhubekani's story but the police arrested him under unclear circumstances. He was released after a number of days," said Murapa.  He said witnesses were getting frustrated with having to travel to Zambia for a trial that never kicks off. - See more at: ,56,56,,,,,,152,786906621360090,/ZambianWatchdog/photos/a.574571859260235/786906621360090

Scott said sorry during the Vice President's question time in response to a question by Chembe Member of Parliament Mwansa Mbulakulima who wanted to find out whether he has problems in the selection of words to use or it is deliberate in view of his recent utterances which appear to have hurt the people of southern province.   Scott says the trouble is that he is quite a high profile person and is straight forward when he talks.  He has also thanked some UPND Members of Parliament for discussing the matter with him.  The vice President has come under heavy criticism over his utterances which have been viewed as divisive.  In a recent BBC interview, Dr Scott referred to the people of southern province as a minority tribe campaigning and insinuating that there would be a Presidential by-election in the country.  And Scott has told Parliament that Government has agreed that all statements on the President's health or whereabouts will be dealt with by State House.  The Vice President was responding to a question by Muchinga Member of Parliament Howard Kunda who wanted him to update the house and the nation on the state of health of President Michael Sata.  Meanwhile International Fellowship of Christian Churches [IFCC] President Bishop Simon Chihana says the people of Sothern province should accept Dr Scott's apology.  Bishop Chihana has told QFM News that the Vice President should however be mindful of the statements he makes considering it is not the first time his statements have sparked an uproar citing the statement he made on South Africans.  He says Dr Scott should guard against such statements to avoid sparking a worse situation.,107,107,,,,,,208,772472636136822,/ZambianWatchdog/photos/a.574571859260235/772472636136822

Most cabinet ministers have been refusing to take part in a cabinet meeting chaired by Wynter Kabimba whom they believe is acting as president illegally.  Instead, only six ministers have been willing to meet.  But a seasoned civil servant with vast experience with cabinet matters has told the Watchdog that a cabinet meeting can take place even without the majority of ministers. The seasoned civil servant explained that, under the Zambian system, ministers are only advisory to the executive president who in this case is considered to be the cabinet itself.    He said there is no law in the Zambian constitution or cabinet manual that requires a quorum to be met for cabinet to sit as long as the president is in attendance. This is the legacy of Kenneth Kaunda’s dictatorship.   The civil servant said that this is one of the anomalies that were supposed to be rectified in the new constitution.    But the issue now is that some ministers believe there is no acting president.    On Monday 23RD June 2014 three days after President Sata was evacuated, cabinet meeting could not take place as ministers Chishimba Kambwili, Edgar Lungu, Yanfwa Mukanga, Nkandu Luo and others told Kabimba point blank that they do not recognise him as acting president.   ‘They just came here to quarrel and after fighting most of them left, leaving Kabimba and his five supporters to strategize, a contact said. Finance minister Alexander Chikwanda, even though he loathes Kabimba is said to be trying to restore order in the regime.  The source named vice President Guy Scott, Gender Minister Inonge Wina, Home Affairs Minister Dr. Ngosa Syambikyula, Labour Minister Fackson Shamenda and Local Government Minister Emmanuel Chenda as the ministers on the side of Kabimba.  Information minister Joseph Katema was sick again that day so it is difficult to know which side he is.   Other deputy ministers such as Miles Sampa are backing Kabimba but do not sit in cabinet.  Secretary to the Cabinet Dr. Rowland Msiska also attended the meeting.  "This week the number could have improved because of reports of the President leaving the hospital. I think others have started fearing that in case the President comes back, then trouble," the source said.  Kabimba is probably the most unlikeable person in Zambia, politically.  He is hated within the PF, few people like him in cabinet and the majority of PF cadres have no kind words for him.  Even in his family he has problems. His father is not juts a staunch UPND official but is a UPND official in their village in Mwembeshi. Kabimba is a nominated MP (not elected), he is an appointed (not elected) Secretary General of the PF. And now he is a questionable  (not elected) acting president.

ObjectId("5e0ca44f4c36d57ff9611e87"),Zambian Watchdog,,2014-06-04 10:31:09,'PUKUTA MWANZA IS WRONG, SATA IS SICK AND THAT AFFECTS ALL OF US'  Editor,  On 3 June 2014 The Evangelical Fellowship of Zambia (EFZ) Executive Director Pukuta Mwanza said among other things that "those that think the President is not in good health should instead commit him in prayers" and that "the President is in a better position to say whether he is well or not instead of speculating on his health".  The PF government machinery is on record assuring the people that the president is well and that there is no need to worry.  On 4 June 2014, the president himself assured the people that he is fine and that his carrying out his duties as president normally. But then why should there be so much speculation even after all these assurances and are Zambians wrong to speculate and talk about the president's health?  First and foremost, the president and the PF should understand that the presidency is part of the governance system and any person that occupies the office of president becomes the property of the government. He becomes head of state and his decisions which potentially affects all the 13 million Zambian are affected by his state of health. If the head of state is sick to an extent were his sickness affects his ability to discharge his official duties, then the Zambian people could be justified in discussing his health because they are directly affected.  The events of the past few weeks seem to provide input into our daily discussions in offices, on the streets, our homes, market places, in public places, etc. On 1 May 2014, I so happened to have been among the many workers that turned up for labour day celebrations in Lusaka. I had not seen the president for some time before this day. I was shocked at his physical appearance as I matched passed him and it goes without saying that apart from his historical one minute speech, the day's gossip centered around the president's appearance, he looked very pale.  Then came the court appearance on 21 May 2014. This appearance raises alot of legal questions and otherwise. For example, does our president listen to advise? Because I doubt that his advisors advised his to go to court. The way he behaved in court, was that normal behavour befitting the head of state? Is everything really ok up stairs? And then there is the famous photo shot from the court as he was leaving, that photo speaks volumes.  Africa freedom day events 25 May 2014! We saw how the president struggled to walk straight  at the freedom statue and how the whole event was cut short.  The award giving ceremony at state house was cut short, only seven people were awarded and the rest were to be awarded later. No speeches which is strange for our president, he loves to talk.  He failed to turn up for the official opening of the Heros stadium and no official explanation has been given.  On 4 May 2014, I saw him on ZNBC 19:00 hours main news talking about him being fit. According to EFZ Executive Director Pukuta Mwanza, this should settle the president's health debate since the president said he was fit. Well, I beg to differ. We have been here before as Zambian. If history has taught us anything especially in African, it is not to take a sitting president's word on his health. The late FTJ said power is sweet and African history has taught us that the political hunger zone and the president's handlers would rather the president expires in office than step down at the expense of the nation.  We are back at the cross roads, all the signs are there that the president is not well and has not been for a long time. Who is to call for a medical board according to the constitution? Going by our current weak constitution, we are stuck with our president. There is serious need to strengthen our governance institutions and instruments.  The current constitution places the responsibility of starting the process to investigate the president's health on cabinet which owes its allegiance to the president. I don't see any of the PF cabinet members doing that and later on any other government. The constitution provides:  Article 36. [Removal of President on grounds of incapacity] (1) If it is resolved by a majority of all the members of the Cabinet that the question of the physical or mental capacity of the President to discharge the functions of his office ought to be investigated, and they so inform the Chief Justice, then the Chief Justice shall appoint a board consisting of not less than three persons selected by him from among persons who are qualified as medical practitioners under the law of Zambia or under the law of any other country in the Commonwealth, and the board shall inquire into the matter and report to the Chief Justice on whether or not the President is, by reason of any infirmity of body or mind, incapable of discharging the functions of his office.   (2) If the board reports that the President is incapable of discharging the functions of his office, the Chief Justice shall certify in writing accordingly and shall table such certificate, with the report of the board before the National Assembly who shall on a motion, passed by a two thirds majority (a) ratify the decision of the board, and thereupon the President shall cease to hold office; or (b) reject the decision of the board and cause a further inquiry into whether or not the President is incapable of discharging the functions of his office and shall thereafter decide on such questions by a two-thirds majority vote, which decision shall be final. (3) Where the Cabinet resolve that the question of the physical or mental capacity of the President to discharge the functions of his office shall be investigated, the President shall, until another person assumes the office of President or the Board appointed under clause (1) reports that the President is not incapable of discharging the functions of his office, whichever is earlier, cease to perform the functions of his office and those functions shall be performed by -- or (b) in the absence of the Vice-President or if the Vice-President is unable, by reason of physical or mental infirmity, to discharge the functions of his office, by such member of the Cabinet as the Cabinet shall elect: Provided that any person performing the functions of the office of President under this clause shall not dissolve the National Assembly nor, except on the advice of the Cabinet, revoke any appointment made by the President. (4) A motion for the purposes of clause (1) may be proposed at any meeting of the Cabinet.  In our current setting, I don't see the president's auntie constituting such a board, another problem that comes with nepotism. I am not a legal practitioner but I am sure this country is not short of brilliant minds that can fix such systematic problems.  In my opinion, given what I have seen and heard from government officials, the president and the people I have mingled with, we do have a problem at hand which has political, economical and social consequences. If not handled well, the peace we so often  love to talk about may slip though our fingers. Lets man-up as a country and stop the rot. A fish rots from the head.

He said it was the bank's desire to complement government's efforts in enhancing literacy levels in the country. Education permanent secretary, Chishimba Nkosha, observes that the levels of reading were very low among Zambian children in schools. "The 2012 Read to Succeed baseline study on early-grade reading revealed that 89 per cent of grade two learners and 80 per cent of grade three learners cannot read, which calls for concerted efforts to encourage the reading culture in children," he said.

Below is a reproduced statement signed by MISA Zambia chairperson Hellen Mwale.  RESPECT THE RIGHT TO FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION AND THE MEDIA – MISA ZAMBIA  The Media Institute of Southern Africa (MISA) Zambia is disturbed with the calls by Copperbelt Minister Mwenya Musenge that radio stations in the country must notify the police before they host political party leaders on their programmes. This statement is not only disappointing and retrogressive, especially from a party that benefited so much from the Zambian media to gain popularity and win the vote, but a big danger to the rights of the Zambian citizens to express themselves freely, to access vital and truthful information and to media independence.   MISA Zambia would like to urge the Patriotic Front to teach its members that democracy is a governance system in which ideas are the only commodity that is traded through freedom of expression which can be achieved via appearance on radio, television or through meetings and  other means as social media.  However, it seems the party is trying to curtail this right in order to stop dissenting views or ability of others to share their ideas and opinions as provided by our constitution which is the supreme law of the land. We urge the PF to denounce the violence and bring to an end this violent behavior  of their cadres instead of them extending their intimidation to the media which every citizen is free to use to express their views.  The rights to freedom of expression and access to information in addition to the media’s ability to operate independently are vital in any society especially a democratic one as they protect other human rights such as the right to access clean water, better health facilities while they prevent bad governance andt which are common in our country.  Therefore, we wish to urge the PF to educate its cadres and teach them that Zambia is a democracy in which only ideas compete and not blows or any form of terror. Zambia is not a mafia state where the most violent take the reins of power, instead it is only those with the brilliant ideas that should triumph.

MINISTER of Defence Edgar Lungu says Zambia’s security has been put at risk by allowing a foreign national operate an airstrip in Luangwa. Speaking when he visited Luangwa airstrip on Saturday, Mr Lungu said it is scandalous and a threat to national security to allow a foreigner run a sensitive facility like an airstrip.  The minister wondered where and how the Mozambican got authority to operate the airstrip. “Who signed the concession for him to be operating our airstrip and who is he accountable to.” Mr Lungu asked. Government officials in Luangwa were at pains to explain to Mr Lungu why a Mozambican is in charge of operations at the airstrip. He said Government will not sit idly by and allow such a the situation to continue. Mr Lungu said he will engage the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to assess the situation and examine the goods coming in and out of the country through Luangwa airstrip. “As Government, we need to know how this Mozambican has been managing the airstrip and who he has been accountable to,” Mr Lungu said. Luangwa district commissioner Eunie Mumba is also concerned about the management of the airstrip. “We have serious security challenges on the airstrip because we do not know what is coming in and going out of the country,” Mr Mumba said. He assured, however, that Government will get to the bottom of the matter. Meanwhile, Mr Lungu has said Zambia has continued enjoying cordial relationships with Mozambique and Zimbabwe. He said, however, that he will find out why the Zimbabwean government closed the route through Luangwa to South Africa which truck drivers and other traders had been using.  “It is good to maintain peace as we trade.

Chuumbwe's militia which was formed with full support of Fred M’membe at the peak of calls to throw Wynter Kabimba out of PF is technically organized and heavily armed as they underwent some serious military training at one of Chuumbwe's farms in Chongwe and continue receiving military equipment from Sudan.   Typical example is how they professionally ambushed Mulenga Sata's boys at the airport and slaughtered one.   This group consists of former military men, security guards and a few diehard Kabimba supporters. Deadly as it maybe, this group only operates as a special force to protect the Wynter/Mmembe cartel.   They have an underground armoury in Chongwe which Michael Sata and his dull intelligence system has failed to locate.  Remember Chuumbwe's farm being searched by police. Mulenga Sata's militia on the other hand is the biggest one boasting of more than a thousand members. They call themselves soldiers. Eddie Gowa "Commando" a former personal body guard and mechanic to vice president Guy Scot is the leader seconded by Innocent Kalimanshi "Ino". (Commando dumped Guy Scot because of his short hand. he is stingy).   Their base is the Lusaka Intercity Bus Terminus. They call it American Barracks and claim to be more powerful than even Mushili. These have no military training whatsoever but depend on the banditry experience of their special unit of ex jailbirds they call the "Red heads" or "ba red". They have combats too (like they showed you during Youth day celebrations).   The recruitment process for these ex-jail birds is like this: the ex-prisoners who are already in the militia will bring names of the most deadly colleagues who have remained in prison that would be of great use to the militia. commission with strict instructions to make sure they are on the final list to be handed over to the president.   The president would finally receive the list and pardon these deadly criminals knowingly or unknowingly. When they come out of prison, they owe their allegiance to commando and Mulenga Sata and are always ready to kill for him but they are allowed to go back to their criminal activities and told to always contribute to the militia what they make from robberies.  This is the money that has made Mulenga Sata the billionaire that he is today. In addition to this funding from the released criminals, and of course the loot from intercity bus terminus, Mulenga's militia collects monies from all bus stations. They have recruited vulnerable youths to be closing doors for buses in transit so that the buses at that particular station can load and pay K15 which is later handed over to Eddie Gowa at Intercity bus terminus enroute to Mulenga Sata's account.   So every time you are harassed by those stinky drunk youths wearing yellow and Orange reflectors stopping you to jump on a bus know they are just making money for the Lusaka mayor Mulenga Sata.   This is the militia you see carrying Pangas grabbing land and attacking opposition leaders and supporters. Now that Mulenga Sata has started campaigning for presidency expect a lot more casualties because while Alexander Chikwanda has agreed to back him, Chishimba Kambwili has made it clear he wants the presidency too and the cartel are ready for the showdown. The opposition should arm itself too if it is to successfully defend its leadership.

Frank Bwalya, leader of the Alliance for a Better Zambia (ABZ)  April 8, 2014.  President Michael Chilufya Sata should resign as Republican President because he has become a danger to Zambia’s peace and stability.  We should all stop burying our heads in the sand and admit that Mr Sata has been behaving in a manner that is highly questionable. He has already done things that have potential to plunge our country into untold turmoil.  The notorious mismanagement of the economy has compounded the suffering of our people and created the kind of discontentment that threatens social harmony. It is also clear that the manner in which Mr Sata has abused his powers to block the Bembas from enthroning their paramount chief Chitimukulu namely Henry Kanyanta Sosala can lead to breakdown in law and order.  Moreover, Mr Sata’s recent open threat to sort out Bishop George Lungu of the Catholic Diocese of Chipata has potential to destroy the unity and harmonious co-existence that our country has sustained since independence. If Bishop Lungu died, God forbid, in a car accident without any foul play or died of natural causes such as heart attack Zambians would rise against the government in a manner that may lead to unprecedented proportions of violence and anarchy.  This is because it would be almost impossible to prove the innocence of Mr Sata’s government in such a death. We should not forget that some civil wars humanity has witnessed including genocides such as the Rwanda genocide were triggered by the killing of one person. As such, anything bad that may happen to Bishop Lungu or indeed any other person who is critical of PF’s bad governance would be blamed on the PF government.  Mr Sata should resign because he has also failed to protect and uphold our Republican Constitution contrary to the oath he undertook when he was sworn in. By threatening citizens including Bishop John Mambo and Bishop Lungu in the manner he has done, Mr Sata has essentially abrogated constitutional rights and freedoms of these citizens. Such rights and freedoms include freedom of conscience and association. Mr Sata has also undermined the freedom of movement of those he has threatened to sort out. I know for sure that Bishop Lungu and all citizens that are perceived to be enemies of PF will not move freely and associate with other people and groups. These citizens will always watch their backs and restrict their movement.  The reality is that we are all living in fear of being sorted out for condemning the lies of PF and opposing the corruption and mediocrity of PF leadership.  Finally, we call upon all Zambians to join the “Red Card” campaign as part of the agenda to force Mr. Sata to resign for the sake of continued peace and stability in our country.

Dr. Fundanga's advice comes in the wake of concerns by economic experts that the US$178 million which the Central Bank claims it injected into the market to stabilize the Kwacha could at best and if it was injected at all only provide temporal relief.  Meanwhile, one week after the purported injection of $178 million, the Kwacha has lost more value. Check on Bank of Zambia for yourself   And these are just central Bank rates. The value of the Kwacha in commercial banks and other commercial financial institutions is even worse.  Fundanga says his idea of strengthening the Kwacha is based on the fact that factors that have led to its depreciation including the strengthening of the US Dollar and the fall in copper prices are beyond the country's control and that the intervention the central Bank has made may not solve the problem.  of the country's export base.  The former Bank of Zambia Governor has told QFM News in an interview that this is in view of the fact that nontraditional exports are growing with the latest statistics indicating that the country exported to a tune exceeding US$3 billion dollars compared to the year 2002 when country was only exporting up to US$200 million.  And Dr. Fundanga has advised that interventions the Central Bank makes in the country's economy should not be by way of announcing what its involvement will be.  Dr. Fundanga explains that if for example the Central Bank announces what its interventions in the country's foreign exchange will be, currency traders could take positions and buy the foreign exchange to depress the currency further more and sell the same foreign currency back onto the market.  He says this is why while interventions by the Central Bank are allowed, such interventions should be done in such a way that they do not alert currency traders.,88,88,,,,,,84,713006068750146,/ZambianWatchdog/photos/a.574571859260235/713006068750146

Sources within the security wings have disclosed that ailing dictator Michael Sata has now ordered police and military personnel from Lusaka and Copperbelt to reinforce those that have been mobilised from all the districts in Eastern province with a view to literally abduct the UPND leader and his entourage that includes his vice-president Dr. Canisius Banda.  "We have been ordered to abduct them and maim them big time. Teams have been assembled and will be airlifted in Zambia Airforce choppers from City Airport in Lusaka and some from Ndola. There will be blood-bath in Eastern province just mark our words. The reception HH received has really scared the PF and Mr. Sata and they are determined to end his meetings even with live ammunition as was the case in the morning in Mambwe District," sources have revealed.  Mr. Hichilema has so far defied police ban on the holding of political meetings in the country as he has vowed to go ahead.  In the morning, riots broke-out at a place called Masumba in Mambwe District at a time Mr. Hichilema was still meeting chiefs and other traditional leaders in the area.   People started gathering as early 08:00 hours for the UPND meeting that was scheduled for 12:00 hours and police moved and started firing teargas and assaulted hundreds of innocent and defenceless citizens with some seriously injured with broken collar bone and taken to nearby kamoto mission hospital.  UPND officials also complained of being trailed by hordes of gun-welding police officers.  UPND vice-president has called on all citizens to come to the rescue of the nation because so that people's basic liberties and freedoms of association can be restored.  he said.  And UPND Deputy Secretary General Kuchunga Simusamba says the party has instructed its members to always arm themselves against the Police whenever they are attending public gatherings.  Mr Simusamba says this follows today's incident in Mambwe district in Eastern province where UPND members were brutalized by Police.  And Mr. Simusamba says UPND president Hakainde Hichilema's tour will continue whether the Police like it or not.

We want our children to grow up into good citizens, be good reporters like those from Maranatha, Times of Zambia, ZNBC, KNC Daily Mail and not like those reporters of the Zambian Watchdog and these other media houses who report lies and scandalize people,” Kabwe District Commissioner Patrick Chishalatold Girl Guides at All Saints UCZ Congregation in Kabwe on Saturday, 15th March, 2014  At the same function, Chishala donated K500 and pledged 50 litres of fuel for the Girl Guides’ trip to Siavonga for the Annual camp meeting.   This comes barely a week after the Watchdog exposed Chishala for swindling youths out of over K22, 000, and probably the K500 he donated came from the same loot.   This is our advice to Chishala, a relative of one of President Sata’s wives Dr. Christine Kaseba:   1. Chishala, you are an intimidated person, just like your aunt Kaseba with whom you worked to mobilize civil servants to demand the dismissal of Inutu Suba when she served as PS for central province. You did this because your aunt kaseba was scared of losing her marriage to Suba, Fred Mmembe’s aunt despite the fact that Christine also just grabbed Sata from Mulenga’s mother. But see, Mmembe and his aunt are still ahead of you; Suba has been moved near state house and is now in charge of Sata’s ‘special duties’.  This is one reason Sata does not always sleep at Nkhwazi house.  State house also has some rooms that function as special bedrooms. This could be one reason your aunt Kaseba has found solace in Secretary to cabinet Dr. Roland Msiska. Do you wonder why you are blacked out by the Post? Do you think M’membe doesn’t know what you did to her aunt?  2.    We did not ask you to steal the offering from UCZ St. Mark’s Congregation, neither did we ask the Reverend Bwalya to convince you to apologise to the congregants. We were not even there.  Don’t hate us when we remind you about that sin.  3. Chishala, Watchdog is not James Kapyanga and Sydney Mushanga, the two Kabwe MPs you have been backbiting because you have plans to contest one of the seats in 2016.  You wrote a bad report to Wynter Kabimba when you were asked to state your opinion about the two MPs when they were considered for ministerial positions.  4.  Chishala, Mr. Abel Shila Chama, the  former DESO for Kabwe was not stupid when he pleaded with Shoprite management to drop the charges of shoplifting against you when you stole groceries which also included your infant’s medicine despite your wife giving you money to pay for the items.  Where did you want to take the money, to one of your concubines?  5. Your blood sister Annie was in grade 12 in 2009 when you chased her from your house. She wrote her examinations from a well-wisher’s house.  Are you worthy to be called a leader? Do you know what your sister went through?  6. You seem to be haunted by your failed sex affair with that lady from Immigration department. We will withhold her name because she is in a relationship with a serious person in Lusaka.  7. You pathological thief! You stole FRA maize, repackaged it and resold it to FRA and using that cadre Muchinda the police divisional operations officer and investigations in the matter have halted. Tell us, do you have a maize field which can produce 500 bags?  8. Even after you pushed for your illegally acqquired plot to be approved by the council, you still went ahead to abuse Naomi Sakala the Director of Planning at Kabwe municipal council to get a plot in Mukuyu residential area near Chindwin barracks. You think we do not know? Time will come when you shall account for all this. For now, enjoy.  9.   Have you finally refunded the 320 youths you swindled money with your fellow crook Webster Diangamo?  10.  For your own information, we don’t need any praises from you, that Sata of yours or indeed any PF officials.  To us that is like sugar coated poison.

Mr President,  Where is former president Fredrick Chiluba's US$ 8.5 million which was in the Zamtrop account?  Zamtrop account is  The ZAMTROP account was a government account controlled by the OP. It was opened on 8 December 1995. On that same day another secret account, which Kenneth Kaunda used to fund rebels in the region such as Jonas Savimbi in Angola, was closed.  The controlling signatory was then Director General of ZSIS, Xavier Franklin Chungu.   If Zambians remember properly, Late President Chiluba consistently said he had personal money from well wishers in the Intelligence account called Zamtrop. Chiluba said he had US$ 8.5 million in that account.  We are aware that former President Rupiah Banda did not do anything on the Zamtrop account because it was subject to litigation.  The London Judgment that found Chiluba and others liable was supposed to be registered in Zambian High Court.   The foolish Evans Hamaundu refused to register the London Judgement in Zambia when he was still a High Court Judge.   Fred Mmembe and Michael Sata then in opposition called for the registration of the judgment.  Why are they quite now? The two mobilised civil society organisations to call for an appeal to the Hamaundu's judgment.   Now that they are in charge of the courts, the police, the OP aand soldiers, they are not talking about this matter anymore.  Rupiah Banda did not act on the Zamtrop account because there were all these issues.  Reports reaching us indicate that President Sata had recently made some moves on the Zamtrop account. We are watching very closely.   So, we repeat the question: where is Chiluba's US$ 8.5 million? Has it been forfeited to the State?  Have PF vultures shared it? These questions beg serious answers.  If transparent International Zambia was transparent, these are matters it should be handling but it can not happen because Badwell Lungu the Executive Director is a PF cadre and is a close form close friend of George Chellah, the Presidential Spokesperson.

"We think there is hope that this may be the real tribunal unlike that mockery in the Kabimba tribunal. We say so because the Chairperson has allowed the petitioner to call any witnesses of his choice but in the disgraced Hamaundu led tribunal,he reserved the right to call witnesses. When the preliminary meeting started, it looked as though we were in a different Zambia under a professional judiciary" one observer who declined to be named said. Another observer and a member of the Law Association of Zambia (LAZ) said Acting Supreme Court Justice Roydah Kaoma impressed him. "You know in the Kabimba tribunal, the petitioners wanted the Acting Chief Justice, the Judiciary Public Relations Officer and Bonaventure Mutale to testify but Hamaundu refused, but Madam Kaoma told Harrington to say give us the names of the people that you intend to call as witnesses so that we can Subpoena them. It was very strange indeed" the source said. The tribunal that officially starts sitting next week will see the petitioners calling twelve witnesses with five coming from government departments while Masebo has indicated she will call twenty witnesses. When contacted for a comment, petitioners lawyers confirmed that unlike Hamaundu, Justice Roydah Kaoma has allowed them to call witnesses of their choice.  Harrington is being represented by the same lawyers who represented Brebner Changala and Lucky Mulusa in the Kabimba tribunal that has so far resulted into a circus as the chairperson Hamaundu a close friend to Kabimba has messed up everything in exchange for ratification as a Supreme court judge.

This follows President Sata’s recent call on public service officers to ignore people talking about the constitution.  Oasis Forum Chairperson, Susanne Matale has told Qfm News that the constitution is not about President Sata or his government but is about the more 13 million Zambians who resolved 18 years ago to have a new constitution.  Rev. Matale who is also Council of Churches in Zambia (CCZ) Secretary General recalls that this is the same new constitution President Sata while opposition leader referred to as what the country needed when he condemned the current constitution as being obsolete and defunct.  She says the Oasis Forum does not understand why President Sata has now turned around now that he is Head of State and say that the current constitution is good when the ruling Patriotic Front (PF) based its 2011 campaigns on delivering a new constitution.  And Reverend Matale has advised President Sata to desist from disparaging fellow leaders in public, citing the instance in which he referred to PF members of parliament as useless.  She says this is because it is very embarrassing for people in the country who are looking forwarding to leadership in the party and government to hear of their leaders being described as useless in public.,134,134,,,,,,86,698536576863762,/ZambianWatchdog/photos/a.574571859260235/698536576863762

Posting on her Facebook page this morning, Masebo, in an apparent reference to the growing rift over the proposed mining by Australian Mining giant Zambezi Resources, said but without elaborating, “I will do what it takes to defend our wildlife in this country because it’s key to our tourism development, and I will play their game because they have asked for it. I just hope it won’t burn them in return”.  In her submissions to the Parliamentary Committee on Tourism and Arts last week, Ms. Masebo said her Ministry feels that the mine project should not go ahead because it will put the existence of the Lower Zambezi National Park at risk.  She said her Ministry is against the decision by the Ministry of Lands, Environment and Natural Resources to issue a mining licence to an Australian investor, Mwembeshi Resources under the parent name of Zambezi Resources in the Lower Zambezi.  She said the mine which will occupy about 25 percent will also reduce the tourism earnings which benefit government and the local people in the area.  “Government risks losing safari fees amounting to over K 84 million and photographic revenue amounting to over K 9 million if the mine is allowed to exist,” Mrs Masebo said.  She said the Ministry of Tourism and Arts follows a policy of sustainable tourism and granting of mining rights to Zambezi Resources goes against the principle of sustainable tourism.  “The Ministry’s considered view is that the Ministry of Lands, Natural Resources and Environmental Protection reconsiders its decision to allow mining activities in the Lower Zambezi National Park,” she said.  Mrs Masebo further says the important steps were ignored in that the basis for the issuance of the 25 years mining licence is not clearly known and the licence was issued before the environmental impact assessment process was completed.  She said plans to declare the Lower Zambezi as a world heritage site may not materialize and this might lead to an unprecedented campaign against Zambia’s tourism which is a key sector in diversifying the economy.  But later Information and Broadcasting Minister maintained that the position taken by the corrupt Lands Minister Harry kalaba to start a large-scale open pit mining in the Lower Zambezi National Park was the correct government position.  Yesterday, the Zambian Watchdog reported that it took Justice Minister Wynter Kabimba and Vice-president Guy Scott to restrain Ms. Masebo from resigning her position based on sharp differences over various issues with the PF government. ts against the granting of a mining licence in one of Zambia’s most precious national park host to some of the rare species of animals in the world, that may face extinction.  Despite the country having been a mining giant for decades now, it has largely remained poor because the proceeds only benefit a few corrupt mine owners abroad as the recent case of KCM scandal has revealed who have been concealing profits.,155,155,,,,,,133,698519360198817,/ZambianWatchdog/photos/a.574571859260235/698519360198817

UPND Deputy Spokesperson Edwin Lifwekelo has said in a statement to that it was  Sata who is supposed to prove to the people of Zambia about his origin and educational background.  Mr.Lifwekelo said that Sata was demeaning the office of President by being trivial. Full statement below:  PRESS STATEMENT The PF Government under the leadership of President Sata has continued to undermine and trivialize the highest office in the land on various pertinent issues affecting the nation. Voting for President Sata and his administration in 2016 will mean demeaning and ridiculing innocent and defenceless citizens such as Hakainde Hichilema at the expense of National development. The people of Zambia now know the true colours of President Sata and his administration and will never be hoodwinked ever again in 2016. Hakainde Hichilema is a Zambian and his parents are Zambian, we can prove to President Sata who has failed lamentably to bring Hakainde’s name into disrepute with all sorts of accusations in the past.   At least some people have come forward who were with Hakainde in secondary school or university and we hope President Sata can do the same. To my knowledge I have never heard anyone claim they were together at school with President Sata. President Sata’s administration is a great threat to public order and should be retired in 2016. We agree with President Sata’s observation that all those who have wished other leaders in the past sick are not worth to be called leaders.  This must include leaders who spoke ill about Mwanawasa, Mazoka and George Kunda’s illness. There should be no double standards.  Hakainde Hichilema has never wished anyone sick, infact his prayer is that leaders in power live beyond 2016 so that they can admire real leadership of the UPND when we take over in 2016. The vision of Hakainde Hichilema and the UPND is to create a United and prosperous Zambia with equal opportunities across ethnic, religious and gender consideration, living in harmony in a free democratic society. Hakainde and UPND’s approach will be characterized by good planning, prudent management, economic efficient and effective utilization of public including donor resources supported by a vigorous but professional fight against corruption. UPND provides the missing link which is knowledge and quality based leadership in the management of our country’s public resources and affairs.

And a number of residents have indicated that they will go to Sata's rally just to see how sick he looks.  'We hear he has been sick and can't even manage to address the nation of TV but now we are told he is coming here so we shall go just to look at him,' said a voter in Katuba. Another voter told the Watchdog that 'we have finished planting maize so we have nothing to do we shall go and see this man but we can't vote for PF even if Sata gives us bags of millie meal at the rally.' The party has faced rejection from the Katuba voters for unfulfilled promises and also for picking a thug of Congolese origin to contest the seat, the party’s internal wrangles have also contributed as the Fred Mmembe supported team Wynter Kabimba comprising ceremonial Vice President Guy Scott, Sylvia Masebo and Emmanuel Chenda have distanced themselves from the campaigns led by defence minister Edgar Lungu.  A state house source has told the Zambian Watchdog that all DCs in the province will attend in addition to the many cadres imported at government expense. Recently the Zambian Watchdog exposed a scam to pay K20,000 to all the over 260 headmen to entice them bring people. PF is also buying voter’s cards from opposition supporters.  “There has been low attendance at PF meetings and besides the rejection of big Moze, the division in the party has made things worse. As you may be aware Edgar Lungu is the campaign manager. Edgar and Wynter don’t get on well, so these guys would like to see Edgar fail, this is also the team which is closer to Fred Mmembe, and that is why you see the Post is not covering the PF activities like they do with other campaigns inspite of Katuba being nearer to Lusaka,” said the source.,49,49,,,,,,84,696176423766444,/ZambianWatchdog/photos/a.574571859260235/696176423766444

Stellah told the Watchdog that there are two women by that name in PF.  This is what she said word for word:  Thank you for your questions. I believe you have most of the information that you asked, because my age and my school and what I am doing are on my website and on the story you posted.  I will only speak about Question 6 and 7.   Matildah Mutale the current treasurer of the ruling party PF Lusaka province committee is NOT my mother. She has never worked at Parliament and I am told she is from Matero.    When the PF spokesperson responded to your post, they were not wrong in saying Matildah Mutale (the treasurer) had no relations or children with my dad but they should have been clear that there are two Matildah Mutale's in the Patriotic Front and this would have dealt with any misconceptions.  I believe that for two people to have children, they should have a relationship. On issues of legality and marriage, I will give you the liberty to carry out your own research or go and ask them because they are both still alive.  Take care and God bless you.  Stella Sata was responding to the following questions put forward to her by ZWD: 1 How old are you? 2 What do you do, attending school or working? 3 Is president Michael Sata your biological father? 4 Do you stay at State House? 5 What is your mother’s name and where does she stay? 6 Is Matildah Mutale the current treasurer for the ruling party PF Lusaka province committee your mother? 7 If she is not, then tell us more about your mother, her current occupation, where she has worked before etc… 8 Were your parents ever married? 9 Does your mother have other children with your father? 10 Anything more you would like to tell the country?  Sorry Stella for mixing the persons but certainly with two women bearing the same name it should be understandable that we got it slightly wrong. Sorry.  On the other hand, the Watchdog maintains that Sata has a sexual relationship with the other Matildah Mutale the current treasurer of the PF Lusaka district. In fact, the information we have is that Sata has about 20 children from about 14 different women some related to each other. That is how morally upright our head of state is.

When he appeared before the parliamentary select committee chaired by MMD Chembe Member of Parliament Mwansa Mbulakulima, Mr. Msiska told the committee that there were 550,000 formal jobs in 2011 but the number had increased to 847,420 in 2012.  Msiska however forgot that in the same committee there was Dr. Situmbeko Musokotwane who was Minister of Finance in 2011. Dr. Musokotwane then told Mr. Msiska that as a former Minister of Finance and responsible for national statistics, he was aware that there were 700,000 formal jobs in 2011. Mr. Mbulakulima then wondered why the ZRA boss wanted to give a wrong impression to the committee.  The committee that also comprised Mazabuka Member of Parliament Garry Nkombo then resolved to send the ZRA chief away and asked him to appear again before the committee on Monday next week with real figures tabulating employment created sector by sector.  “Now you are giving us different statistics. I don’t seem to understand,” Dr Musokotwane said. United Party for National Development (UPND) Mazabuka member of Parliament Garry Nkombo said going by the figures given by ZRA, poverty levels should have reduced because it means that employment or investment has grown by 65 percent. Mr Mbulakulima then requested Mr Msiska to return on Monday with “accurate” statistics. “Give us accurate national figures. Come back on Monday and categorise the jobs created so far,” Mr Mbulakulima said. He said jobs are very important to people because they bring dignity and self-esteem. “Young people are looking for jobs and every government commits itself to creating jobs,” he said. Mr Mbulakulima said unemployment is considered a major challenge that Zambia is facing and some sectors of society have doubted the 200,000 jobs so far created by Government.  PF officials including those working at State House have been announcing different figures  as the number of jobs have they have created.,49,49,,,,,,88,679179088799511,/ZambianWatchdog/photos/a.574571859260235/679179088799511
